<i>MISSOURI
EARTH 1980</i>

2
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:22,939
- Come on!
- Slow down.

3
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:24,786
What do you say, my River Lily?
Come on!

4
00:01:27,348 --> 00:01:29,511
- Where are you taking me?
- Come on, come on, come on.

5
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:34,039
- Look. Look.
- Oh, it's beautiful!

6
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:36,219
I was afraid it wouldn't
take to this soil.

7
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:37,755
But it rooted quickly.

8
00:01:37,755 --> 00:01:40,380
And soon it'll be everywhere.

9
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,161
All across the universe.

10
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:46,379
Well I don't know what
you're talking about...

11
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:48,107
...but I like the
way you say it.

12
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:50,646
My heart is yours...

13
00:01:50,646 --> 00:01:52,081
Meredith Quill.

14
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:56,466
I can't believe I fell
in love with a spaceman.

15
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:28,182
34 YEARS LATER

16
00:02:32,577 --> 00:02:36,656
THE SOVEREIGN
PLANET

17
00:02:46,914 --> 00:02:48,581
Showtime, a-holes!

18
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,981
It's gonna be here any minute.

19
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:53,360
Which will be its loss.

20
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,045
I thought your thing
was a sword.

21
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:58,282
We've been hired to stop an
inter-dimensional beast...

22
00:02:58,282 --> 00:03:00,901
...from feeding on those batteries,
and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?

23
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:02,963
It's just, swords were your thing and
guns were mine

24
00:03:02,963 --> 00:03:06,063
but I guess we're both doing guns now.
I just didn't know that.

25
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:10,481
Drax, why aren't you wearing
one of Rocket's aero-rigs?

26
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,274
- It hurts.
- Hurts?

27
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:16,122
I have sensitive nipples.

28
00:03:17,505 --> 00:03:20,060
Ha ha ha! My nipples
hurt! Oh goodness me!

29
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:22,190
What about him?
What's he doing?

30
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,956
I'm finishing this so we can listen
to tunes while we work.

31
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:27,018
- How is that a priority?
- Blame Quill.

32
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:28,648
He's the one who loves music so much.

33
00:03:28,648 --> 00:03:32,137
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.
That's hardly important right now.

34
00:03:32,783 --> 00:03:34,593
Oh, Okay.
Sure, Quill.

35
00:03:34,593 --> 00:03:38,356
No, seriously, I side with Drax.

36
00:03:38,773 --> 00:03:42,288
No, I understand that.
You're being very serious right now.

37
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:44,702
I can clearly see you winking.

38
00:03:45,197 --> 00:03:47,556
Dammit.
I'm using my left eye?

39
00:03:53,004 --> 00:03:54,435
I am Groot!

40
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:57,455
They were not looking
at you funny.

41
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:04,022
That's intense.

42
00:04:29,357 --> 00:04:33,322
GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2

43
00:05:09,637 --> 00:05:10,937
Groot!

44
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:29,335
Groot, get out of the way!
You're going to get hurt.

45
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:30,411
Hide.

46
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:18,989
No, no!
Spit it out, spit it out, c'mon.

47
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:23,266
Disgusting!

48
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:31,684
The beast's hide is too thick
to be pierced from the outside.

49
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,782
I must cut through it from the inside.

50
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:38,198
No, no, Drax!
Wait a minute!

51
00:07:46,604 --> 00:07:47,904
What is he doing?

52
00:07:47,904 --> 00:07:51,081
He said the skin is too thick to be
pierced from the outside, so he....

53
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:52,979
- That doesn't make any sense!
- I tried telling him that!

54
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,559
Skin's the same level of thickness
from the inside as from the outside!

55
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,060
I realize that.

56
00:07:59,623 --> 00:08:01,325
There is a cut on its neck.

57
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:04,065
Rocket, get it to look up.

58
00:08:06,274 --> 00:08:09,012
Hey, giant sea monkey!
I'm here!

59
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,009
Watch it, Quill!

60
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,270
Yes!
I have single handedly

61
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,041
vanquished the beast!

62
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:08,390
What?

63
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:20,156
- What are they called again?
- Anulax batteries.

64
00:09:20,156 --> 00:09:22,484
Harbulary batteries.

65
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:24,980
That's nothing like
what I just said.

66
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,639
But they're worth thousands
of units a piece, which is...

67
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,952
why the Sovereign hired
us to protect them.

68
00:09:28,952 --> 00:09:31,101
Careful what you say around these
folks, they're easily offended

69
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:33,323
The cost of transgression is death.

70
00:09:34,216 --> 00:09:38,408
We thank you Guardians for putting
your lives on the line.

71
00:09:38,408 --> 00:09:42,197
We could not risk the lives of
our own Sovereign citizens.

72
00:09:42,197 --> 00:09:46,180
Every citizen is born exactly
as designed by the community.

73
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,188
Impeccable, both physically
and mentally.

74
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,378
We control the DNA of our progeny

75
00:09:51,378 --> 00:09:53,677
...germinating them in birthing pods.

76
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:57,438
I guess I prefer to make people
the old fashioned way.

77
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:00,930
Well.  Perhaps someday you could
give me a history lesson...

78
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,134
...in the archaic ways
of our ancestors

79
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:05,933
For academic purposes.

80
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:09,103
I would be honored. Yes.
In the name of research...

81
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:11,516
I think that could be...

82
00:10:11,516 --> 00:10:13,797
...pretty uh, repulsive. I'm...

83
00:10:13,797 --> 00:10:16,270
- I'm not into that kind of casual...
- Please...

84
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:19,705
Your people promised something
in exchange for our services.

85
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:22,493
Bring it and we shall gladly
be on our way.

86
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:37,423
Family reunion. Yay!

87
00:10:37,423 --> 00:10:39,615
I understand she
is your sister.

88
00:10:39,615 --> 00:10:43,436
She's worth no more to me than
the bounty due for her on Xandar.

89
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,855
Our soldiers apprehended her
attempting to steal the batteries.

90
00:10:48,402 --> 00:10:50,402
Do with her as you please.

91
00:10:53,627 --> 00:10:55,498
We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.

92
00:10:55,498 --> 00:10:57,870
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?

93
00:11:00,908 --> 00:11:04,280
- My mother was from Earth.
- And your father?

94
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:09,646
He ain't from Missouri.
That's all I know.

95
00:11:10,118 --> 00:11:11,994
I see it within you.

96
00:11:11,994 --> 00:11:15,303
An unorthodox genealogy

97
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:20,095
A hybrid that seems particularly...

98
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,316
Desleixado.

99
00:11:24,426 --> 00:11:28,324
You know, they told me you people
were conceited douchebags.

100
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,867
But that isn't true at all..

101
00:11:37,424 --> 00:11:39,909
Ah, shit. I'm using my wrong
eye again, aren't I?

102
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:43,255
I'm sorry, that was...that was
meant to be behind your back.

103
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,877
Count yourself blessed
they didn't kill you.

104
00:11:47,258 --> 00:11:50,566
You're telling me.
You want to buy some batteries??

105
00:12:04,831 --> 00:12:08,871
All right, let's get baldly to Xandar
and collect that bounty.

106
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:09,511
Aquelas coisas
sobre meu pai.

107
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,912
Who does she think she is?

108
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:14,134
I know you're sensitive about that.

109
00:13:14,847 --> 00:13:17,701
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just don't know who he is.

110
00:13:19,227 --> 00:13:22,118
Sorry if it seemed like I was
flirting with the High Priestess.

111
00:13:22,823 --> 00:13:25,733
- I wasn't.
- I don't care if you were.

112
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:28,803
Well I feel like you do care.

113
00:13:28,803 --> 00:13:31,814
That's why I'm apologizing.
So, sorry.

114
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,665
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.

115
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:36,839
Damn shadow.

116
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:38,911
There are two types of
beings in the universe.

117
00:13:39,264 --> 00:13:42,352
Those who dance and
those who do not.

118
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:45,905
I first met my beloved
at a war rally.

119
00:13:46,356 --> 00:13:50,821
- Oh god.
- Everyone in the village flailed about dancing.

120
00:13:50,821 --> 00:13:54,532
Except one woman.
My Ovette.

121
00:13:55,386 --> 00:13:57,705
I knew immediately she
was the one for me.

122
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,139
The most melodic song in the
world could be playing..

123
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,820
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

124
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,681
Wouldn't move a muscle.

125
00:14:07,404 --> 00:14:10,186
One might assume she was dead.

126
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:12,637
That does sound pretty hot.

127
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:15,435
It would make my nether-regions engorged.

128
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:17,732
Okay I get it, yes.

129
00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:20,215
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.

130
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,235
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic,

131
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,290
like you.

132
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:33,603
I'm hungry.
Hand me some of that Yaro root.

133
00:14:33,603 --> 00:14:35,442
N�o, ainda n�o est� madura.

134
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,858
- ...and I hate you.
- You hate me?

135
00:14:38,173 --> 00:14:40,945
You left me there while you
stole that stone for yourself.

136
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,956
And yet here you
stand, a hero.

137
00:14:43,956 --> 00:14:47,737
I will be free of these shackles
soon and I will kill you.

138
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:50,650
- I swear.
- No.

139
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,145
You're gonna live out the rest of
your days in a prison on Xandar,

140
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:56,910
wishing you could.

141
00:15:02,915 --> 00:15:05,532
This is weird. We've got a Sovereign fleet
approaching from the rear.

142
00:15:05,532 --> 00:15:08,202
- Why would they do that?
- Perhaps because Rocket stole some of their batteries.

143
00:15:08,202 --> 00:15:09,830
Dude!

144
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,965
Right.
He didn't steal some of those.

145
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:14,003
I don't know why they're after us.
What a mystery this is.

146
00:15:23,978 --> 00:15:25,634
What were you thinking?

147
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:27,350
Dude, they were really
easy to steal!

148
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,929
- That's your defense?
- Come on!

149
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,456
You saw how that High Priestess
talked down to us.

150
00:15:31,456 --> 00:15:33,275
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

151
00:15:33,618 --> 00:15:36,270
Oh, I didn't realize your
motivation was altruism.

152
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,874
It's really a shame the Sovereign
have mistaken your intentions...

153
00:15:38,874 --> 00:15:40,630
- ...and are trying to kill us.
- Exactly!

154
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,414
- I was being sarcastic!!
- No!

155
00:15:42,414 --> 00:15:44,536
You're supposed to use the sarcastic tone!

156
00:15:44,536 --> 00:15:47,055
- Now I look foolish!
- Can we put the bickering on hold...

157
00:15:47,055 --> 00:15:49,074
...'til after we've survived
this massive space battlel?

158
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,583
- More incoming!
- Good!

159
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,636
I want to kill some guys!

160
00:15:59,351 --> 00:16:00,557
You're not killing anyone.

161
00:16:00,557 --> 00:16:02,581
All those ships are remotely piloted.

162
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:07,028
Dammit!

163
00:16:15,973 --> 00:16:18,046
What is the delay, Admiral?

164
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:21,679
High Priestess, the batteries,
they are exceptionally combustible...

165
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,066
...and could destroy the entire fleet.

166
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:26,362
Our concern is their slight
against our people.

167
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:29,772
We hired them and
they steal from us.

168
00:16:30,494 --> 00:16:33,237
It's heresy of the highest order.

169
00:16:33,752 --> 00:16:36,096
All command modules...

170
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:38,573
...fire with the intent to kill.

171
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,834
What's the nearest
habitable planet?

172
00:16:49,732 --> 00:16:51,117
It's called Berhert.

173
00:16:51,117 --> 00:16:52,711
- How many jumps?
- Only one.

174
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,562
But the access point is
47 clicks away.

175
00:16:55,562 --> 00:16:58,889
And you have to go through
that quantum asteroid field.

176
00:17:06,812 --> 00:17:08,494
Quill, to make it through that...

177
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,053
...you'd have to be the
greatest pilot in the universe.

178
00:17:10,053 --> 00:17:11,381
Lucky for us...

179
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:13,620
- I...
- I am.

180
00:17:24,508 --> 00:17:27,399
- What are you doing?
- I've been flying this rig since I was 10 years old.

181
00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:30,485
I was cybernetically engineered
to pilot a spacecraft.

182
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:32,975
You were cybernetically engineered
to be a douchebag!

183
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:34,995
- Stop it!
- Quill, later on tonight,

184
00:17:34,995 --> 00:17:38,188
you're gonna be laying down in your bed and there's
gonna be something squishy in your pillowcase.

185
00:17:38,188 --> 00:17:42,242
And you're gonna be like, What's this?
And it's gonna be because I put a turd in there.

186
00:17:42,449 --> 00:17:45,145
You put your turd in my bed,
I shave you.

187
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:48,273
Oh, it won't be my turd.
It'll be Drax's

188
00:17:50,415 --> 00:17:52,602
I have famously huge turds.

189
00:17:52,602 --> 00:17:55,265
We're about to die, and
this is what we're discussing?

190
00:17:56,597 --> 00:17:58,173
Son of a...!

191
00:17:58,173 --> 00:17:59,949
Dude! Seriously!

192
00:17:59,949 --> 00:18:01,381
Hey, let me...

193
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:15,769
Idiots!

194
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:18,265
Ah! That's what you get when Quill flies.

195
00:18:19,717 --> 00:18:22,066
We still have a Sovereign craft behind us.

196
00:18:24,418 --> 00:18:26,220
Our weapons are down.

197
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,414
Twenty clicks to the jump.

198
00:18:31,513 --> 00:18:32,997
Hold on.

199
00:18:41,728 --> 00:18:43,485
It's not ripe.

200
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:46,694
<i>SPACESUITS FOR EMERGENCY
OR FOR FUN.</i>

201
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,553
Come on, Zylak.
You can do this.

202
00:18:56,629 --> 00:18:57,629
Yes!

203
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:00,593
15 clicks to the jump!

204
00:19:19,052 --> 00:19:20,856
10 clicks!

205
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,481
Die, spaceship!

206
00:19:31,216 --> 00:19:34,042
- You suck, Zylak.
- Typical.

207
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:37,939
It's 5 clicks!

208
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,868
Son of a...!

209
00:19:46,214 --> 00:19:48,470
They went around the field!

210
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:05,783
Someone destroyed all our ships!

211
00:20:05,783 --> 00:20:07,379
What?

212
00:20:10,901 --> 00:20:12,472
Who?

213
00:20:13,507 --> 00:20:14,991
1 click!

214
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:18,260
- What is that?
- Who cares?

215
00:20:18,471 --> 00:20:20,748
That's the jump point!
Go, go!

216
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:25,253
It's a guy.

217
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:36,101
Oh my god.
He's still out there?

218
00:21:05,227 --> 00:21:07,264
Groot, put your seatbelt on!

219
00:21:08,284 --> 00:21:12,041
Prepare for a really bad landing!

220
00:21:41,398 --> 00:21:42,238
BERHERT

221
00:21:54,597 --> 00:21:56,674
That was awesome!

222
00:21:58,566 --> 00:22:00,240
Yes!

223
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:02,867
Look at this!

224
00:22:03,816 --> 00:22:05,598
Where's the other half of our ship?

225
00:22:05,598 --> 00:22:06,773
My ship.

226
00:22:06,773 --> 00:22:09,797
Either one of you could've gotten
us through that field...

227
00:22:09,797 --> 00:22:13,270
...had you flown with what's between
your ears instead of what's between your legs!

228
00:22:14,761 --> 00:22:17,707
If what's between my legs
had a hand on it...

229
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:20,162
...I guarantee I could've
landed this ship with it.

230
00:22:20,162 --> 00:22:23,673
Peter. We almost died because
of your arrogance.

231
00:22:23,673 --> 00:22:26,892
No, like, because he stole...
Anulax batteries.

232
00:22:26,892 --> 00:22:29,386
They're called Harbulary batteries.

233
00:22:29,386 --> 00:22:30,834
No, they're not!

234
00:22:31,085 --> 00:22:33,563
You know why I did it,
Star-Munch?  Hmm?

235
00:22:33,778 --> 00:22:35,375
I'm not gonna answer
to Star-Munch.

236
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:38,451
- I did it because I wanted to!
- Dick.

237
00:22:38,451 --> 00:22:40,525
What are we even talking
about this for?

238
00:22:40,745 --> 00:22:44,223
We just had a little man save
us by blowing up 50 ships!

239
00:22:44,223 --> 00:22:47,142
- How little?
- I, I don't know, like this?

240
00:22:47,142 --> 00:22:49,380
A little one-inch man saved us?

241
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,975
Well, if he got closer, I'm
sure he'd be much larger.

242
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:54,459
That's how eyesight works,
you stupid raccoon.

243
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:56,204
Don't call me a raccoon!

244
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,199
I'm sorry.
I took it too far.

245
00:23:00,138 --> 00:23:02,092
I meant trash panda.

246
00:23:04,048 --> 00:23:05,202
Is that better?

247
00:23:05,893 --> 00:23:07,248
I don't know.

248
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:10,218
It's worse.  It's so much worse.

249
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,709
You son of a...!

250
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:14,279
I've about had it with you!

251
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:16,784
Someone followed you
through the jump point.

252
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:21,042
Set me free.
You'll need my help.

253
00:23:21,405 --> 00:23:22,571
I'm not a fool, Nebula.

254
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:24,448
You are a fool to deprive
yourself a hand in combat.

255
00:23:24,448 --> 00:23:26,972
- You'll attack me the moment I let you go.
- No I won't.

256
00:23:27,214 --> 00:23:30,663
You would think an evil super-villain
would learn how to properly lie.

257
00:23:31,182 --> 00:23:32,948
I bet it's the one-inch man.

258
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:10,295
After all these years,
I've found you.

259
00:24:11,071 --> 00:24:12,540
And who the hell are you?

260
00:24:13,421 --> 00:24:16,418
I figured my rugged good looks
would make that obvious.

261
00:24:17,802 --> 00:24:19,798
My name is Ego.

262
00:24:21,018 --> 00:24:23,232
And I'm your dad, Peter.

263
00:24:26,773 --> 00:24:27,853
CONTRAXIA

264
00:24:37,808 --> 00:24:39,203
You know what they say.

265
00:24:39,203 --> 00:24:41,633
You're out of luck
until you've gone duck.

266
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,715
<i>Yondu!</i>

267
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:11,401
Come on down!

268
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:26,545
...this woman, I ended up marrying her.

269
00:25:26,545 --> 00:25:28,898
I said, Aleta, I love you...

270
00:25:28,898 --> 00:25:30,559
...but you're losing your mind!

271
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,279
And she's always been this way.

272
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,278
I could never trust her, you know.

273
00:25:34,814 --> 00:25:35,895
Stakar.

274
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,776
It's been some time.

275
00:25:44,784 --> 00:25:48,823
Seems like this establishment
is the wrong kind of disreputable.

276
00:25:54,802 --> 00:25:57,596
- Stakar.
- There's 100 Ravager factions.

277
00:25:57,596 --> 00:26:00,940
You just lost the business of 99
of them by serving one.

278
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,268
- Please, sir. Please!
- Get away from me.

279
00:26:08,482 --> 00:26:10,809
You can go to hell then!

280
00:26:11,474 --> 00:26:13,717
I don't give a damn what
you think of me!

281
00:26:13,717 --> 00:26:15,420
So, what are you following us for?

282
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,241
You're gonna listen to
what I gotta say!

283
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:19,924
I don't gotta listen to nothing!
You betrayed the code!

284
00:26:19,924 --> 00:26:21,952
Ravagers don't deal in kids!

285
00:26:21,952 --> 00:26:24,915
I told you before!
I didn't know what was going on!

286
00:26:24,915 --> 00:26:27,130
You didn't know 'cause you didn't
want to know 'cause it made you rich.

287
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:29,449
I demand a seat at the table.

288
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:31,582
I wear these flames, same as you.

289
00:26:31,582 --> 00:26:32,953
You may dress like us...

290
00:26:32,953 --> 00:26:35,888
...but you'll never hear the Horns
of Freedom when you die, Yondu.

291
00:26:36,188 --> 00:26:38,118
And the Colors of Ogord...

292
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:40,847
...will never lash over your grave.

293
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:43,706
If you think...

294
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,432
I take pleasure in exiling you...

295
00:26:49,352 --> 00:26:50,729
...you're wrong.

296
00:26:52,097 --> 00:26:54,246
You broke all our hearts.

297
00:27:09,381 --> 00:27:10,681
Pathetic.

298
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,191
First, Quill betrays us...

299
00:27:14,191 --> 00:27:17,388
...and Yondu just lets
him go scot-free.

300
00:27:17,388 --> 00:27:19,050
We followed him...

301
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:22,753
...because he was the one who wasn't
afraid to do what needed to be done.

302
00:27:22,753 --> 00:27:25,020
Seems he's going soft.

303
00:27:25,654 --> 00:27:28,339
If he's so soft,
why are you whispering for?

304
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:30,526
You know I'm right, Kraglin.

305
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:33,229
You best be very careful

306
00:27:33,229 --> 00:27:35,214
what you say about our captain.

307
00:27:35,415 --> 00:27:36,812
Who is that?

308
00:28:19,255 --> 00:28:21,137
Yondu Udonta.

309
00:28:21,652 --> 00:28:24,003
I have a proposition for you.

310
00:28:24,726 --> 00:28:28,904
I hired Yondu to pick you up when 
your mother passed away.

311
00:28:28,904 --> 00:28:30,800
But, instead of returning you...

312
00:28:31,657 --> 00:28:33,005
...Yondu kept you.

313
00:28:33,618 --> 00:28:35,839
I have no clue as to why.

314
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:38,972
Well, I'll tell you why.

315
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,902
'Cause I was a skinny little kid who
could squeeze into places adults couldn't.

316
00:28:41,902 --> 00:28:44,160
It made it easier for thieving.

317
00:28:44,386 --> 00:28:48,026
Well. I've been trying to
track you down ever since.

318
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,081
I thought Yondu was your father.

319
00:28:50,081 --> 00:28:52,612
What?  We've been together
this whole time...

320
00:28:52,612 --> 00:28:55,435
...and you thought Yondu was
my actual blood relative?

321
00:28:55,808 --> 00:28:58,997
- You look exactly alike.
- One's blue!

322
00:29:00,528 --> 00:29:02,521
No, he's not my father!

323
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:04,523
Yondu is the guy
who abducted me.

324
00:29:04,523 --> 00:29:07,014
Kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight.

325
00:29:07,014 --> 00:29:09,125
And kept me in terror by
threatening to eat me.

326
00:29:09,865 --> 00:29:11,373
- Eat you?
- Yeah.

327
00:29:11,373 --> 00:29:13,325
Ah, that son of a bitch!

328
00:29:13,995 --> 00:29:15,577
How did you locate us now?

329
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,309
Well, even where I reside, out
past the edge what's known...

330
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:22,030
...we've heard tales about the
man they call Star-Lord.

331
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,832
What say we head out there right now?

332
00:29:24,361 --> 00:29:25,964
Your associates are welcome.

333
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,188
Even that triangle-face monkey, there.

334
00:29:28,746 --> 00:29:30,046
I promise you...

335
00:29:30,341 --> 00:29:33,073
...it's not like any other
place you've ever seen.

336
00:29:33,473 --> 00:29:34,602
And there,

337
00:29:35,058 --> 00:29:39,521
I can explain your very
special heritage.

338
00:29:40,684 --> 00:29:44,912
Finally get to be the father 
I've always wanted to be.

339
00:29:47,154 --> 00:29:48,454
Excuse me.

340
00:29:49,357 --> 00:29:50,657
I've gotta take a whiz.

341
00:29:57,306 --> 00:29:58,606
I'm not buying it.

342
00:30:01,571 --> 00:30:03,075
Let's go take a walk.

343
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,945
I am Mantis.

344
00:30:16,205 --> 00:30:17,837
What are you doing?

345
00:30:17,837 --> 00:30:19,138
Smiling.

346
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,950
I hear it is the thing to do
to make people like you.

347
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:25,719
Not if you do it like that.

348
00:30:27,939 --> 00:30:30,928
Oh.
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.

349
00:30:30,928 --> 00:30:35,325
I do not understand the
intricacies of social interaction.

350
00:30:37,941 --> 00:30:39,808
Can I pet your puppy?

351
00:30:39,808 --> 00:30:41,355
It's adorable.

352
00:30:45,132 --> 00:30:46,432
Yes.

353
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:59,994
That is called a practical joke!

354
00:31:02,788 --> 00:31:05,982
I liked it very much!

355
00:31:06,215 --> 00:31:08,139
I just made it up.

356
00:31:11,094 --> 00:31:12,562
Give me a break!

357
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,044
After all this time, you're gonna
show up and just all of a sudden...

358
00:31:15,044 --> 00:31:16,895
- ...you want to be my dad?
- I hear you.

359
00:31:16,895 --> 00:31:18,795
You know, by the way,
this could be a trap.

360
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:22,799
Ok? The Kree ~Perus, the 
Ravagers, they all want us dead.

361
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,766
- I know, but...
- But what?

362
00:31:24,766 --> 00:31:27,555
What was that story you told
me about Zardu Hasselfrau?

363
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:30,274
- Who?
- He owned a magic boat.

364
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:34,310
- David Hasselhoff?
- Right.

365
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,864
Not in a magic boat.
A talking car.

366
00:31:36,864 --> 00:31:38,324
Why did he talk, again?

367
00:31:38,324 --> 00:31:41,859
To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.

368
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:44,695
As a child, you would carry
his picture in your pocket...

369
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,562
and you would tell all
the other children...

370
00:31:46,562 --> 00:31:49,051
...that he was your father,
but that he was out of town..

371
00:31:49,051 --> 00:31:51,248
Shooting Knight Rider or touring
with his band in Germany.

372
00:31:51,248 --> 00:31:53,486
I told you that when I was drunk.
Why are you bringing it up now?

373
00:31:53,486 --> 00:31:56,114
- I love that story.
- I hate that story.

374
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,023
It's so sad!

375
00:31:58,533 --> 00:32:02,750
As a kid, I used to see all the other
kids all playing catch with their dad.

376
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,637
And I wanted that, more than
anything in the world.

377
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:07,728
That's my point, Peter.

378
00:32:08,241 --> 00:32:11,292
What if this man
is your Hasselhoff?

379
00:32:13,255 --> 00:32:16,075
Listen.  If he ends
up being evil...

380
00:32:17,073 --> 00:32:18,687
...we'll just kill him.

381
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,460
You're leaving me with that fox?

382
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,905
He's not a fox.

383
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,866
Shoot her if she does
anything suspicious.

384
00:32:31,772 --> 00:32:34,022
- Or if you feel like it.
- Okay.

385
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:36,807
Hey. It'll be just a
couple of days.

386
00:32:36,807 --> 00:32:39,502
We'll be back before Rocket's
finished fixing the ship.

387
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:44,119
What if Sovereign come?

388
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:46,553
There's no way for them to
know we're here.  Let's go.

389
00:32:46,553 --> 00:32:47,992
I'm uncertain about parting ways.

390
00:32:47,992 --> 00:32:49,591
God, you're like an old woman.

391
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,320
Because I'm wise?

392
00:32:52,386 --> 00:32:54,198
Why do you have so much luggage?

393
00:32:54,198 --> 00:32:56,480
I don't want Groot
playing with my things.

394
00:32:59,183 --> 00:33:01,171
I hope daddy isn't as big of a
dick as you,

395
00:33:01,171 --> 00:33:02,472
Orphan Boy.

396
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:05,350
What is your goal here?

397
00:33:05,663 --> 00:33:07,357
To get everbody to hate you?

398
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:09,248
Because it's working.

399
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,481
Hey. Can I ask you a
personal question?

400
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:59,570
Oh! Noone has ever asked
me a personal question.

401
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,499
Your antennae, what are they for?

402
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:02,909
Their purpose?

403
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:05,151
Yes, Quill and I have a bet.

404
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:07,161
- Ugh. You're not supposed to say that.
- I say...

405
00:34:07,514 --> 00:34:10,551
that if you're about to go through
a doorway that's too low...

406
00:34:10,994 --> 00:34:13,756
...the antennae will feel this and
keep you from being decapitated.

407
00:34:13,756 --> 00:34:15,762
Right.
And if it's anything other than...

408
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,359
...you specifically not being
decapitated by a doorway,

409
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:19,228
I win.

410
00:34:19,228 --> 00:34:21,818
They are not for feeling doorways.

411
00:34:23,204 --> 00:34:25,405
I think...

412
00:34:25,405 --> 00:34:27,418
...they have something to do
with my empathic abilities.

413
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:28,527
What are those?

414
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:30,318
If I touch someone,

415
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,511
I can
feel their feelings.

416
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:34,330
- You read minds?
- No.

417
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:36,799
Telepaths know thoughts.

418
00:34:36,799 --> 00:34:39,100
Empaths feel feelings.

419
00:34:40,209 --> 00:34:41,509
Emotions.

420
00:34:43,342 --> 00:34:44,646
May I?

421
00:34:45,556 --> 00:34:46,856
Oh, all right.

422
00:34:54,512 --> 00:34:57,022
You feel love.

423
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,179
Yeah, I guess feel a general
unselfish love for just about everybody...

424
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:02,480
No!

425
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,507
- Romantic, sexual love.
- No, no, I don't.

426
00:35:05,507 --> 00:35:07,276
- For her!
- No!

427
00:35:07,276 --> 00:35:08,577
That is not...

428
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:11,274
Okay.

429
00:35:14,248 --> 00:35:17,502
She just told everyone
your deepest, darkest secret!

430
00:35:17,502 --> 00:35:19,673
Dude, come on, I think you're
overreacting a little bit.

431
00:35:19,673 --> 00:35:22,132
You must be so embarrassed!

432
00:35:24,826 --> 00:35:27,462
Do me!
Do me! Do me!

433
00:35:33,537 --> 00:35:36,816
I have never felt such humor.

434
00:35:40,663 --> 00:35:42,997
So unbelievably not cool.

435
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:52,650
Touch me, and the only thing you're
gonna feel is a broken jaw.

436
00:35:58,697 --> 00:36:03,103
I can also alter emotions,
to some extent.

437
00:36:03,103 --> 00:36:04,467
Yeah, like what?

438
00:36:04,743 --> 00:36:06,993
If I touch someone who is sad...

439
00:36:07,409 --> 00:36:11,058
...I can ease them into
contentment for a short while.

440
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,030
I can make a stubborn person compliant.

441
00:36:15,789 --> 00:36:18,936
But I mostly use it to
help my master sleep.

442
00:36:19,214 --> 00:36:24,079
He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.

443
00:36:25,871 --> 00:36:27,338
Do one of those on me.

444
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,516
Sleep.

445
00:37:37,147 --> 00:37:38,700
I love this song.

446
00:38:10,439 --> 00:38:11,739
There.

447
00:39:27,941 --> 00:39:30,549
Ain't so tough now,
without all your toys.

448
00:39:30,549 --> 00:39:31,850
Are ya?

449
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:36,209
Move!

450
00:39:51,627 --> 00:39:52,927
Crap.

451
00:39:58,116 --> 00:40:01,980
- Hey there, rat!!
- How's it going, you blue idiot?

452
00:40:02,237 --> 00:40:03,925
Not so bad.

453
00:40:04,325 --> 00:40:06,686
We got ourselves a pretty
good little gig here.

454
00:40:06,686 --> 00:40:10,067
This golden gal with quite a
high opinion of herself...

455
00:40:10,067 --> 00:40:13,478
...has offered us a large sum to
deliver you and your pals over to her...

456
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:15,382
...'cause she wants to kill y'all.

457
00:40:16,049 --> 00:40:17,438
Your Friend...

458
00:40:17,438 --> 00:40:19,191
There's too many of them.

459
00:40:19,191 --> 00:40:22,457
He needs my help.
If you care about him....

460
00:40:22,457 --> 00:40:25,464
...you need to get
me out of these bonds.

461
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,264
They are going to kill him!

462
00:40:27,264 --> 00:40:29,643
I'll tell you, it was
pretty easy to find you.

463
00:40:29,643 --> 00:40:31,013
I put a tracer on
your ship back there...

464
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:33,174
...during the war with Xandar.

465
00:40:33,174 --> 00:40:35,201
Give me your word you
won't hurt Groot...

466
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:37,765
...and I'll tell you
where the batteries are.

467
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:41,116
Lucky for you, my
word don't mean squat.

468
00:40:41,116 --> 00:40:43,931
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.

469
00:40:43,931 --> 00:40:45,824
Otherwise...what?

470
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,525
We'll take them batteries.

471
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:50,706
They're worth, what, a
quarter mil on the open market?

472
00:40:50,706 --> 00:40:53,290
That Priestess offered
us a million.

473
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:55,708
A quarter is only one third of that!

474
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,349
A quarter ain't a third.

475
00:40:57,349 --> 00:40:59,221
A quarter is 25.

476
00:40:59,221 --> 00:40:59,787
No.

477
00:40:59,787 --> 00:41:02,768
We can't even buy a pair
of boots with 25 units.

478
00:41:02,768 --> 00:41:06,518
Enough! The point is, we ain't stupid enough

479
00:41:06,518 --> 00:41:08,753
to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

480
00:41:08,753 --> 00:41:11,300
The whole dang Nova Corps'd be on us.

481
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,047
That ain't right!

482
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:16,294
I just gotta say it this
one time, captain.

483
00:41:16,784 --> 00:41:19,319
No matter how many times
Quill betrays you...

484
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:22,370
...you protect him like none
of the rest of us much matter.

485
00:41:23,082 --> 00:41:26,050
- I'm the one what sticks up for you!!
- Take it easy, Kraglin.

486
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,753
Damn straight, lads.
He's gone soft.

487
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:32,054
I suppose it's time for
a change in leadership.

488
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:39,775
Put your ~gob guns down!

489
00:41:39,775 --> 00:41:43,073
There must be some kind of
peaceful resolution to this, fellas.

490
00:41:43,073 --> 00:41:45,940
Or even a violent one, where
I'm standing over there.

491
00:42:04,103 --> 00:42:05,903
Well, hello boys.

492
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:12,808
It's not ripe.

493
00:42:33,649 --> 00:42:35,329
EGO'S PLANET

494
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,730
Welcome, everyone, to my world.

495
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,253
Wow. You have your own planet?

496
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:09,614
Come on.  It's no larger
than your Earth's moon.

497
00:43:10,008 --> 00:43:11,308
Humility.

498
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:12,910
I like it.

499
00:43:13,482 --> 00:43:16,162
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.

500
00:44:00,742 --> 00:44:03,678
You own a planet and can destroy
two dozen spaceships

501
00:44:03,678 --> 00:44:04,979
 without a suit.

502
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,320
What are you exactly?

503
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:12,179
I'm what's called a Celestial, sweetheart.

504
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:16,749
A Celestial, like a God?

505
00:44:17,595 --> 00:44:19,984
Oh, a small "g", son.

506
00:44:20,294 --> 00:44:21,994
At least on the days I'm

507
00:44:21,994 --> 00:44:23,425
feeling as humble as Drax.

508
00:44:38,526 --> 00:44:42,106
I don't know where I came from, exactly.

509
00:44:42,106 --> 00:44:44,837
The first thing I remember is...

510
00:44:44,837 --> 00:44:47,428
...flickering. Adrift in
the cosmos, utterly...

511
00:44:47,922 --> 00:44:50,722
...and entirely alone.

512
00:44:51,809 --> 00:44:53,789
Over millions of years...

513
00:44:53,789 --> 00:44:57,700
...I learned to control
the molecules around me.

514
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:01,241
I grew smarter and stronger.

515
00:45:03,514 --> 00:45:06,714
And I continued building from there.

516
00:45:06,714 --> 00:45:08,815
Layer by layer...

517
00:45:08,815 --> 00:45:11,766
...the very planet you walk on now.

518
00:45:14,067 --> 00:45:15,567
But I wanted more.

519
00:45:16,491 --> 00:45:17,791
I desired...

520
00:45:18,878 --> 00:45:20,178
...meaning.

521
00:45:21,205 --> 00:45:25,321
There must be some life out
there in the universe...

522
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:28,302
...besides just me, I thought.

523
00:45:28,302 --> 00:45:32,390
And so, I set myself the task
of finding it.

524
00:45:33,275 --> 00:45:34,875
I created...

525
00:45:34,875 --> 00:45:38,556
...what I imagined biological
life to be like...

526
00:45:38,556 --> 00:45:42,587
...down to the most minute detail.

527
00:45:43,993 --> 00:45:45,493
Did you make a penis?

528
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:48,200
- Dude!
- What is wrong with you?

529
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,641
If he is a planet,

530
00:45:49,641 --> 00:45:51,942
how could he
make a baby with your mother?

531
00:45:51,942 --> 00:45:53,736
He would smush her!

532
00:45:55,177 --> 00:45:57,777
I...ugh!  I don't need to hear
how my parents...

533
00:45:58,855 --> 00:46:00,155
Why?

534
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:03,455
My father would tell the story of
impregnating my mother

535
00:46:03,455 --> 00:46:05,726
- every winter solstice.
- That's disgusting.

536
00:46:05,726 --> 00:46:07,657
It was beautiful.

537
00:46:09,373 --> 00:46:11,273
You Earthers have hang-ups.

538
00:46:11,273 --> 00:46:12,623
Yes, Drax.

539
00:46:12,623 --> 00:46:13,924
I got a penis.

540
00:46:14,537 --> 00:46:15,837
Thank you.

541
00:46:15,837 --> 00:46:17,338
And it's not half bad.

542
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,510
I also have

543
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,411
pain receptors
and a digestive system...

544
00:46:22,411 --> 00:46:24,732
...and all the accompanying junk.

545
00:46:25,127 --> 00:46:29,897
I wanted to experience what it
truly meant to be human.

546
00:46:30,228 --> 00:46:33,242
As I set out amongst the stars...

547
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,225
...'til I found...

548
00:46:36,225 --> 00:46:37,727
...what I sought.

549
00:46:39,416 --> 00:46:40,716
Life.

550
00:46:42,362 --> 00:46:45,662
I was not alone in the
universe after all.

551
00:46:50,609 --> 00:46:52,409
When did you meet my mother?

552
00:46:55,951 --> 00:46:57,651
Not long after.

553
00:47:02,858 --> 00:47:04,870
It was, with Meredith,

554
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:07,718
that I
first experienced love.

555
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:13,365
I called her my River Lily.

556
00:47:17,427 --> 00:47:19,747
And from that love, Peter...

557
00:47:22,886 --> 00:47:24,186
You.

558
00:47:30,534 --> 00:47:33,834
I've searched for you for so long.

559
00:47:35,175 --> 00:47:36,865
And when I heard of
a man from Earth...

560
00:47:36,865 --> 00:47:40,326
...who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...

561
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:45,019
...I knew you must be the
son of the woman I loved.

562
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:48,434
If you loved her, why
did you leave her?

563
00:48:25,584 --> 00:48:27,864
Sorry about this!

564
00:48:58,827 --> 00:49:02,180
Captain! Help me!
Please help!

565
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,427
Captain!

566
00:49:06,627 --> 00:49:08,827
You're the one what killed those men...

567
00:49:08,827 --> 00:49:11,128
...by leading them
down the wrong path.

568
00:49:11,128 --> 00:49:12,829
Because you're weak.

569
00:49:14,935 --> 00:49:16,335
And stupid.

570
00:49:18,217 --> 00:49:20,591
It's time for the Ravagers...

571
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:24,421
...to rise once again to glory
with a new captain...

572
00:49:24,421 --> 00:49:25,621
Taserface!

573
00:49:33,468 --> 00:49:36,083
I'm sorry.
Your name is...

574
00:49:36,083 --> 00:49:37,472
It's Taserface?

575
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,162
That's right.

576
00:49:39,162 --> 00:49:42,363
Do you shoot tasers
out of your face?

577
00:49:42,363 --> 00:49:44,722
It's metaphorical!

578
00:49:48,255 --> 00:49:49,555
For what?

579
00:49:49,804 --> 00:49:51,400
For...

580
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,101
It is a name what strikes fear...

581
00:49:54,101 --> 00:49:56,665
...into the hearts of
anyone what hears it!

582
00:49:58,797 --> 00:50:00,391
Okay...

583
00:50:00,391 --> 00:50:02,892
Whatever you say.

584
00:50:03,479 --> 00:50:05,699
You shut up.
You're next.

585
00:50:06,633 --> 00:50:10,901
Udonta, I've been
waiting a long time to...

586
00:50:11,388 --> 00:50:12,202
What?

587
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:16,343
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

588
00:50:17,064 --> 00:50:20,134
I just keep imagining
you waking up in the morning, sir...

589
00:50:20,134 --> 00:50:23,668
...looking in the mirror and,
in all seriousness, saying to yourself...

590
00:50:23,668 --> 00:50:27,334
"You know what would be a really
kick-ass name?

591
00:50:27,334 --> 00:50:29,327
Taserface!".

592
00:50:30,811 --> 00:50:33,401
That's how I hear you in my head!

593
00:50:33,401 --> 00:50:34,890
I can't take it anymore!

594
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:37,166
What was your second choice?

595
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:38,837
Scrotum Hat?

596
00:50:41,691 --> 00:50:44,901
New plan.
We're killing you first.

597
00:50:44,901 --> 00:50:46,207
Well...

598
00:50:46,207 --> 00:50:48,482
Dying is certainly better

599
00:50:48,482 --> 00:50:51,425
than having to live an entire life...

600
00:50:51,425 --> 00:50:54,270
...as a moronic shitbag who thinks
Taserface is a cool name.

601
00:50:54,476 --> 00:50:57,156
That's enough killing for today.

602
00:51:01,563 --> 00:51:03,412
She's the daughter of Thanos.

603
00:51:06,602 --> 00:51:09,095
I thought you were the biggest
sadist in the galaxy.

604
00:51:09,095 --> 00:51:11,282
That was when daddy was
paying my bills.

605
00:51:12,353 --> 00:51:15,083
The Priestess wants to
kill the fox herself.

606
00:51:15,775 --> 00:51:17,575
And he has bounties on his head

607
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:20,039
in at least 12 Kree provinces.

608
00:51:21,646 --> 00:51:23,307
I assure you...

609
00:51:23,307 --> 00:51:26,574
I am not as easy a mark as an
old man without his magic stick...

610
00:51:26,574 --> 00:51:28,678
...or a talking woodland beast.

611
00:51:30,232 --> 00:51:32,340
I want ten percent of the take.

612
00:51:34,309 --> 00:51:36,579
And a couple more things.

613
00:51:38,131 --> 00:51:39,894
We got a whole box of hands...

614
00:51:39,894 --> 00:51:42,011
- ...if that one don't work out.
- It is fine.

615
00:51:43,722 --> 00:51:46,286
You, uh, think them Kree is
gonna execute the captain?

616
00:51:46,286 --> 00:51:50,107
The Kree consider themselves
merciful.  It will be painless.

617
00:51:51,189 --> 00:51:54,804
Well, uh, here it is.
It's the best ship we got.

618
00:51:55,272 --> 00:51:57,091
The location of Ego's planet
in the nav.

619
00:51:57,091 --> 00:51:59,631
We'll wire you the ten percent
once we's paid.

620
00:52:00,157 --> 00:52:02,175
What're you gonna do
with your share?

621
00:52:03,185 --> 00:52:07,291
As a child, my father would have Gamora
and me battle one another in training.

622
00:52:08,695 --> 00:52:10,821
Every time my sister prevailed...

623
00:52:11,444 --> 00:52:14,622
...my father would replace a
piece of me with machinery...

624
00:52:15,267 --> 00:52:18,439
...claiming he wanted me
to be her equal.

625
00:52:19,661 --> 00:52:21,584
But she won.

626
00:52:21,584 --> 00:52:24,706
Again and again and again,

627
00:52:24,706 --> 00:52:27,385
never once refraining.

628
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:32,770
So, after I murder my sister...
I will buy a warship 

629
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:35,227
with every
conceivable instrument of death.

630
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:39,231
I will hunt my father like a
dog and I will tear him apart slowly...

631
00:52:39,742 --> 00:52:41,487
piece by piece,

632
00:52:41,487 --> 00:52:45,534
until he knows some semblance
of the profound and unceasing pain...

633
00:52:45,534 --> 00:52:48,637
...I know every single day.

634
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:51,530
Yeah...

635
00:52:52,864 --> 00:52:55,505
...I was talking about
a pretty necklace.

636
00:52:55,984 --> 00:52:57,968
Or a nice hat, you know.

637
00:52:57,968 --> 00:53:01,188
Something to make the other
girls go, Ooooh, that's nice.

638
00:53:05,497 --> 00:53:09,186
Anyways, happy trails.

639
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:21,330
My mother told everyone my
father was from the stars.

640
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:26,545
She had brain cancer, so
everyone thought she was delusional.

641
00:53:26,545 --> 00:53:29,060
- Peter.
- Listen, I'd love to believe
all of this, I really would,

642
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:34,678
But you left the most wonderful
 woman ever,

643
00:53:35,132 --> 00:53:36,585
 to die alone.

644
00:53:36,585 --> 00:53:40,487
I didn't want to leave
your mother, Peter.

645
00:53:40,487 --> 00:53:43,379
If I don't return regularly
to my planet...

646
00:53:43,379 --> 00:53:44,873
...and the light within it...

647
00:53:44,873 --> 00:53:46,981
...this form will wither and perish.

648
00:53:46,981 --> 00:53:49,181
Then why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?

649
00:53:49,181 --> 00:53:51,942
A criminal, of all people, to
come and to fetch me.

650
00:53:51,942 --> 00:53:54,052
I loved your mother, Peter!

651
00:53:54,052 --> 00:53:56,978
I couldn't stand to step
foot on an Earth...

652
00:53:56,978 --> 00:54:00,553
...where she wasn't living!
You can't imagine what that's like!

653
00:54:00,553 --> 00:54:02,733
I know exactly what that feels like!

654
00:54:03,348 --> 00:54:05,744
I had to watch her die!

655
00:54:10,335 --> 00:54:15,296
Over the millions and millions
of years of my existence...

656
00:54:15,296 --> 00:54:17,552
...I've made many mistakes, Peter.

657
00:54:18,626 --> 00:54:20,835
But you're not one of them.

658
00:54:22,952 --> 00:54:27,314
Please give me the chance to be
the father she would want me to be.

659
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:36,239
There's so much that I need to

660
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:37,966
teach you about this planet...

661
00:54:38,822 --> 00:54:40,737
...and the light within.

662
00:54:40,737 --> 00:54:43,714
They are a part of you, Peter.

663
00:54:45,404 --> 00:54:47,005
What do you mean?

664
00:54:48,149 --> 00:54:50,056
Give me your hand, son.

665
00:54:51,292 --> 00:54:52,448
Here.

666
00:54:53,733 --> 00:54:55,762
Hold them like that.

667
00:54:58,875 --> 00:55:00,176
Now,

668
00:55:02,155 --> 00:55:05,179
close your eyes
and concentrate.

669
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:09,724
Take your brain to the
center of this planet.

670
00:55:14,657 --> 00:55:17,029
Yes! Yes!

671
00:55:17,029 --> 00:55:19,263
- Yes!
- What was it?

672
00:55:19,688 --> 00:55:21,754
It's okay, just relax.
Concentrate.

673
00:55:21,754 --> 00:55:23,870
You can do it.
Bring it back.

674
00:55:24,226 --> 00:55:25,532
Yes!

675
00:55:26,253 --> 00:55:29,679
Now, shape it.

676
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:31,253
Feel that energy.

677
00:55:35,591 --> 00:55:36,991
Yes.

678
00:55:40,646 --> 00:55:42,246
You're home.

679
00:55:44,502 --> 00:55:45,891
Peter...

680
00:56:19,038 --> 00:56:22,252
How'd you get to this
weird, dumb planet?

681
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:24,935
Ego found me in my larvae state.

682
00:56:24,935 --> 00:56:27,075
Orphan on my homeworld.

683
00:56:27,882 --> 00:56:31,718
He raised me by hand and
kept me as his own.

684
00:56:31,718 --> 00:56:33,702
So, you're a pet.

685
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:36,023
 I suppose.

686
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:39,312
People usually want cute pets.

687
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,781
Why would Ego want such
a hideous one?

688
00:56:41,781 --> 00:56:43,178
I am hideous?

689
00:56:43,178 --> 00:56:46,058
You are horrifying to look at, yes.

690
00:56:48,421 --> 00:56:50,051
But that's a good thing.

691
00:56:51,017 --> 00:56:52,753
When you're ugly and
someone loves you...

692
00:56:52,753 --> 00:56:54,721
...you know they love
you for who you are.

693
00:56:56,337 --> 00:56:58,573
Beautiful people never
know who to trust.

694
00:56:58,573 --> 00:57:02,014
Well, then I am certainly
grateful to be ugly.

695
00:57:03,763 --> 00:57:06,913
Those pools, they remind
me of a time...

696
00:57:06,913 --> 00:57:10,303
...when I took my daughter to the
Forgotten Lakes of my homeworld.

697
00:57:11,625 --> 00:57:13,252
She was like you.

698
00:57:13,252 --> 00:57:14,762
Disgusting?

699
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:17,083
Innocent.

700
00:57:49,524 --> 00:57:51,054
Drax?

701
00:57:51,288 --> 00:57:53,401
There's something I
must tell you.

702
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:04,688
- What's going on?
- This gross bug lady
is my new friend.

703
00:58:04,688 --> 00:58:08,012
I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.

704
00:58:08,397 --> 00:58:10,360
You're not ugly.
Drax.

705
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,496
- What are you talking about?
- Mantis,

706
00:58:12,496 --> 00:58:14,892
Can you show us where
we'll be staying?

707
00:58:15,552 --> 00:58:17,592
Why are there no other
beings on this planet?

708
00:58:17,592 --> 00:58:19,599
The planet is Ego.

709
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:22,490
A dog would not invite a
flea to live on his back.

710
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:23,993
And you're not a flea?

711
00:58:23,993 --> 00:58:25,977
I'm a flea with a purpose.

712
00:58:26,771 --> 00:58:28,489
I help him sleep.

713
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:32,876
What were you about to say
to Drax before I walked out?

714
00:58:37,613 --> 00:58:38,736
Nothing.

715
00:58:39,246 --> 00:58:41,246
Your quarters are this way.

716
00:58:48,708 --> 00:58:51,346
We deliver you to
the Kree in the morning.

717
00:58:54,204 --> 00:58:57,334
Neither one of you will last
much longer after that.

718
00:58:57,998 --> 00:58:59,624
Okay, Taserface.

719
00:59:00,582 --> 00:59:04,514
Hey, tell the other guys, we said...
"Hi, Taserface."

720
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:11,891
Oh! Hey, what about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?

721
00:59:11,891 --> 00:59:13,320
No, Gef.

722
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,120
It's too adorable to kill.

723
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,774
Take it to the tailor.

724
00:59:18,516 --> 00:59:21,536
No offense, but your employees
are a bunch of jerks.

725
00:59:24,076 --> 00:59:27,197
I was a Kree battle slave for
20 years

726
00:59:27,197 --> 00:59:29,340
when Stakar freed me.

727
00:59:30,657 --> 00:59:33,484
He offered me a place with the Ravagers.

728
00:59:33,985 --> 00:59:37,819
He said, all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.

729
00:59:38,405 --> 00:59:39,783
But I was young...

730
00:59:41,012 --> 00:59:44,495
...and greedy and stupid.

731
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:47,372
Like you stealing those batteries.

732
00:59:47,372 --> 00:59:49,018
That was mostly Drax.

733
00:59:50,467 --> 00:59:53,639
Me & Stakar, and the other captains...

734
00:59:54,767 --> 00:59:57,371
...we weren't so different from
you and your friends.

735
00:59:57,861 --> 01:00:00,240
The only family I ever had.

736
01:00:00,861 --> 01:00:02,852
When I broke the code...

737
01:00:05,086 --> 01:00:06,928
...they exiled me.

738
01:00:07,664 --> 01:00:09,448
This is what I deserve.

739
01:00:09,448 --> 01:00:11,467
Slow down, drama queen.

740
01:00:11,467 --> 01:00:14,475
You might deserve this, but I don't.
We gotta get out of here.

741
01:00:16,156 --> 01:00:17,816
Where's Quill?

742
01:00:17,816 --> 01:00:20,565
Ah, he went off with his old man.

743
01:00:20,565 --> 01:00:22,583
- Ego?
- Yeah.

744
01:00:22,583 --> 01:00:24,866
It's a day for dumb-ass names.

745
01:00:27,387 --> 01:00:30,318
You smiled, there for a second,
I got a warm feeling.

746
01:00:30,318 --> 01:00:33,010
But then it was ruined by
those disgusting-ass teeth.

747
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:35,383
You're like, a professional
asshole, or what?

748
01:00:35,383 --> 01:00:36,684
Pretty much a pro.

749
01:00:36,684 --> 01:00:39,541
Why didn't you deliver Quill
to Ego like you promised?

750
01:00:40,332 --> 01:00:41,820
He was skinny.

751
01:00:42,316 --> 01:00:44,428
He fit into places we couldn't.

752
01:00:45,151 --> 01:00:46,987
Good for thieving.

753
01:00:52,047 --> 01:00:54,821
I got an idea on how
to get out of here.

754
01:00:56,293 --> 01:00:58,397
But we're gonna need
your little friend.

755
01:00:59,952 --> 01:01:03,453
Mascot! Mascot!
Mascot! (repeating)

756
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:15,993
You fellas all want
~sausage drunk?

757
01:01:22,489 --> 01:01:25,373
Look how cute it is
when it's all riled up.

758
01:01:25,373 --> 01:01:27,820
It's god-dang precious.

759
01:01:41,721 --> 01:01:43,486
Psst!  Hey, twig!

760
01:01:43,486 --> 01:01:45,187
Come here.

761
01:01:45,986 --> 01:01:47,256
Come on.

762
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:56,859
Man. What'd they do to you?

763
01:01:59,694 --> 01:02:02,402
Hey, you want to
help us get out of here?

764
01:02:03,033 --> 01:02:06,217
There's something I need you
to get and bring back to me.

765
01:02:06,424 --> 01:02:10,627
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin.

766
01:02:11,123 --> 01:02:13,318
The thing I wore in my head.

767
01:02:13,318 --> 01:02:15,318
There's a drawer next to the bunk.

768
01:02:15,318 --> 01:02:17,300
It's in that. It's red.

769
01:02:17,538 --> 01:02:19,343
You got it?

770
01:02:53,702 --> 01:02:55,436
That's my underwear.

771
01:02:55,436 --> 01:02:57,723
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't
know what you were talking about.

772
01:02:57,723 --> 01:02:59,789
You have to explain
it more careful.

773
01:03:01,386 --> 01:03:05,399
It's a prototype fin.

774
01:03:10,528 --> 01:03:11,999
That's an Orloni.

775
01:03:11,999 --> 01:03:13,911
It's a fin, Groot.

776
01:03:13,911 --> 01:03:15,789
You try it this time.

777
01:03:16,453 --> 01:03:17,708
All right.

778
01:03:18,842 --> 01:03:21,185
That's Vorker's eye.

779
01:03:21,185 --> 01:03:23,133
He takes it out when he sleeps.

780
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:25,971
- Go, look again.
- But leave the eye here.

781
01:03:26,732 --> 01:03:29,554
- Why?
- He's gonna wake up tomorrow...

782
01:03:29,554 --> 01:03:31,457
and he's not gonna know...

783
01:03:31,457 --> 01:03:33,822
...where his eye is!

784
01:03:40,687 --> 01:03:42,552
That's a desk.

785
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:44,743
We told you it was this big.

786
01:03:51,542 --> 01:03:54,260
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere...

787
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:56,712
...with a bunch of
severed human toes.

788
01:03:56,712 --> 01:04:00,276
Okay, then let's just agree
to never discuss this.

789
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:07,919
The drawer you want to open
has this symbol on it.

790
01:04:07,919 --> 01:04:09,620
Okay?

791
01:04:18,035 --> 01:04:19,518
What? No!

792
01:04:19,518 --> 01:04:21,524
He thinks you want him
to wear it as a hat.

793
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:22,726
That's not what I said!

794
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:25,198
- I am Groot!
- He's relieved you don't want him to.

795
01:04:25,198 --> 01:04:27,088
- I am Groot.
- He hates hats.

796
01:04:27,088 --> 01:04:29,178
- I am Groot.
- On anyone, not just himself.

797
01:04:29,178 --> 01:04:30,979
- I am Groot?
- One minute, you think someone

798
01:04:30,979 --> 01:04:33,087
has a weird shaped head, the next minute,

799
01:04:33,087 --> 01:04:34,923
just because, you realize part of that head is the hat.

800
01:04:35,314 --> 01:04:37,099
That's why you don't like hats?

801
01:04:37,593 --> 01:04:40,170
This is an important
conversation right now?

802
01:05:15,032 --> 01:05:16,936
What you have there?

803
01:05:24,852 --> 01:05:27,220
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

804
01:05:29,124 --> 01:05:31,526
They killed all my friends.

805
01:05:34,606 --> 01:05:37,230
Get the third quadrant
ready for release.

806
01:05:43,645 --> 01:05:45,014
One more thing.

807
01:05:45,967 --> 01:05:48,311
You got any clones of
Quill's old music on the ship?

808
01:06:35,648 --> 01:06:38,164
He's got it!
Yondu got the fin!

809
01:06:38,164 --> 01:06:39,077
Go!

810
01:07:17,895 --> 01:07:18,967
Down there!

811
01:09:15,979 --> 01:09:17,673
You maniac!

812
01:09:19,642 --> 01:09:21,620
The whole ship's gonna blow.

813
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:34,556
Not the whole ship.

814
01:09:52,935 --> 01:09:55,581
- Who is this?
- I am sending you the

815
01:09:55,581 --> 01:09:58,498
coordinates for Yondu's ship.

816
01:09:59,116 --> 01:10:01,201
- Release the quadrant!
- Aye, captain!

817
01:10:01,201 --> 01:10:04,080
I only ask one thing.

818
01:10:04,591 --> 01:10:06,532
That your High Priestess...

819
01:10:06,532 --> 01:10:10,489
...tell him the name of
the man what sealed his fate.

820
01:10:11,304 --> 01:10:13,710
Taserface.

821
01:10:38,623 --> 01:10:40,844
- Where to, captain?
- Ego.

822
01:10:42,819 --> 01:10:44,342
No, boy!

823
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:57,492
It ain't healthy, mammalian body
to hop more than 50 jumps at a time.

824
01:10:57,492 --> 01:11:01,372
- I know that.
- We're about to do 700!

825
01:11:16,263 --> 01:11:18,393
So, I guess this could all
be mine someday.

826
01:11:19,941 --> 01:11:22,516
Rocket?
Rocket, are you there?

827
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:31,870
What are you doing, Peter?

828
01:11:34,798 --> 01:11:36,098
Dance with me.

829
01:11:36,532 --> 01:11:38,319
I'm not going to dance with you.

830
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:40,657
This is Sam Cooke...

831
01:11:40,657 --> 01:11:43,482
...one of the greatest
Earth singers of all time.

832
01:12:15,452 --> 01:12:17,571
Drax says you're not a dancer.

833
01:12:18,742 --> 01:12:21,825
If you ever tell anyone about this...

834
01:12:21,825 --> 01:12:23,128
...I will kill you.

835
01:12:23,863 --> 01:12:25,388
When are we going to do something

836
01:12:25,388 --> 01:12:27,498
about this unspoken thing between us?

837
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,434
What unspoken thing?

838
01:12:31,953 --> 01:12:33,137
This...

839
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:36,535
Cheers, Sam and Diane.

840
01:12:37,097 --> 01:12:40,276
...guy and a girl on a
TV show who dig each other...

841
01:12:40,276 --> 01:12:42,746
...but never say it because the
TV ratings would go down...

842
01:12:42,746 --> 01:12:44,047
...sort of thing.

843
01:12:44,047 --> 01:12:45,698
There's no unspoken thing here.

844
01:12:47,893 --> 01:12:50,030
Well, it's a catch-22, because if
you said it then it would be spoken...

845
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:52,364
...and you'd be a liar.

846
01:12:52,364 --> 01:12:54,181
So, by not saying it...

847
01:12:54,771 --> 01:12:58,268
...you are telling the truth
and admitting that there is.

848
01:12:59,328 --> 01:13:01,139
No, that's not what I...

849
01:13:03,915 --> 01:13:08,039
What we should be discussing
right now is, something about this place.

850
01:13:08,387 --> 01:13:10,239
It doesn't feel right.

851
01:13:10,727 --> 01:13:12,412
What are you talking about?

852
01:13:13,371 --> 01:13:15,071
You're the one who
wanted me to come here.

853
01:13:15,071 --> 01:13:17,362
That girl, Mantis...
...she's afraid of something.

854
01:13:17,981 --> 01:13:20,243
Why are you trying to take
this away from me?

855
01:13:20,454 --> 01:13:23,920
- I'm not trying....
- He's my father. He's blood.

856
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,829
Well you have blood on Earth,
you never wanted to return there.

857
01:13:25,829 --> 01:13:27,732
Again, you made me come here.

858
01:13:27,732 --> 01:13:30,354
And Earth, Earth is the place
where my mother died in front of me.

859
01:13:30,354 --> 01:13:33,827
No, it's because that place is
real, and this is a fantasy.

860
01:13:33,827 --> 01:13:36,828
This is real!
I'm only half human, remember?

861
01:13:36,828 --> 01:13:38,206
That's the half I'm worried about.

862
01:13:38,929 --> 01:13:40,553
I get it.
You're jealous...

863
01:13:40,553 --> 01:13:43,902
...because I'm part god and
you like when I'm the weak one.

864
01:13:43,902 --> 01:13:46,289
You were insufferable to begin with.

865
01:13:46,542 --> 01:13:48,165
I haven't been able
to reach Rocket.

866
01:13:48,165 --> 01:13:49,765
I'm going to go outside and
try to get a signal.

867
01:13:49,765 --> 01:13:52,416
You know what?
This is not Cheers after all.

868
01:13:52,829 --> 01:13:55,586
This is whatever the show is where
one person is willing to...

869
01:13:55,586 --> 01:13:57,466
...open themselves up to new
possibilities,

870
01:13:57,466 --> 01:14:00,553
and the other person is a jerk who
doesn't trust anybody!

871
01:14:00,553 --> 01:14:02,318
It's a show that doesn't exist!

872
01:14:02,318 --> 01:14:04,219
That's why it would get zero ratings.

873
01:14:04,219 --> 01:14:06,117
I don't know what Cheers is.

874
01:14:06,117 --> 01:14:07,772
I finally found my family.

875
01:14:07,772 --> 01:14:09,408
Don't you understand that?

876
01:14:10,266 --> 01:14:11,878
I thought you already had.

877
01:14:38,665 --> 01:14:40,356
Damn it.

878
01:15:10,475 --> 01:15:11,775
Psychopath!

879
01:17:10,716 --> 01:17:12,016
Are you kidding me!

880
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:38,143
I win.

881
01:17:38,143 --> 01:17:40,010
I win, I bested you in combat.

882
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:41,995
No.
I saved your life.

883
01:17:41,995 --> 01:17:43,922
Well you were stupid
enough to let me live.

884
01:17:43,922 --> 01:17:44,749
You let me live!

885
01:17:44,749 --> 01:17:46,552
I don't need you to
always try and defeat me!

886
01:17:46,552 --> 01:17:49,240
I'm not the one who just flew across the
universe just because I wanted to win.

887
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,991
Do not tell me what I want.

888
01:17:50,991 --> 01:17:53,189
I don't need to tell you 
what you want! It's obvious!

889
01:17:53,189 --> 01:17:56,666
You were the one who wanted to win.
And I just wanted a sister!

890
01:18:03,223 --> 01:18:04,890
You were all I had.

891
01:18:05,915 --> 01:18:08,133
But you were the one
who needed to win.

892
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:11,965
Thanos pulled my eye
from my head...

893
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:14,081
...and my brain from my skull...

894
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:17,191
...and my arm from my body...

895
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:20,525
...because of you.

896
01:18:43,993 --> 01:18:45,293
You all right, son?

897
01:18:48,679 --> 01:18:52,367
I saw your girl stomp off
a little earlier in quite a huff.

898
01:18:52,367 --> 01:18:53,741
Yeah.

899
01:18:53,741 --> 01:18:57,117
It's fortuitous, you listening to this song.

900
01:18:57,707 --> 01:18:59,948
You know, uh, "Brandy?"

901
01:18:59,948 --> 01:19:01,660
By Looking Glass?

902
01:19:03,051 --> 01:19:05,220
A favorite of your mom's.

903
01:19:05,502 --> 01:19:06,802
Yes.  Yeah, it was.

904
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:09,891
One of Earth's greatest
musical compositions.

905
01:19:09,891 --> 01:19:13,384
- Perhaps its very greatest.
- Yeah, yes!

906
01:19:13,384 --> 01:19:17,422
You know, Peter, you and I, we're...
we're the sailor in that song.

907
01:19:19,229 --> 01:19:21,183
He came on a summer's day.

908
01:19:21,792 --> 01:19:24,907
Bringing gifts from far away.

909
01:19:25,502 --> 01:19:29,326
Like the child I put
in your mother.

910
01:19:29,326 --> 01:19:31,952
Or the freedom you brought Gamora.

911
01:19:34,365 --> 01:19:37,664
Brandy, you're a fine girl.

912
01:19:37,664 --> 01:19:40,380
What a good wife you would be.

913
01:19:41,906 --> 01:19:44,836
My life, my love,

914
01:19:44,836 --> 01:19:48,372
my lady, is the sea.

915
01:19:48,828 --> 01:19:50,968
The sea calls the sailor back.

916
01:19:50,968 --> 01:19:54,464
And he loves the girl, but
that's not his place.

917
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:58,265
The sea calls upon him as
history 

918
01:19:58,265 --> 01:19:59,569
calls upon great men.

919
01:20:00,316 --> 01:20:04,273
And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.

920
01:20:04,904 --> 01:20:07,511
Well, you may not be
mortal, but me...

921
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:11,239
No, Peter. Death will remain a
stranger to both of us,

922
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:13,998
...as long as the light
burns in this planet.

923
01:20:14,692 --> 01:20:16,181
I'm immortal?

924
01:20:18,562 --> 01:20:20,574
- Really?
- Yes!

925
01:20:20,978 --> 01:20:23,214
As long as this light exists.

926
01:20:23,901 --> 01:20:25,958
And I can use the light to

927
01:20:25,958 --> 01:20:28,052
build cool things, like...

928
01:20:28,268 --> 01:20:29,780
...how you made this whole planet?

929
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:32,856
Well, it may take you a few
million years of practice...

930
01:20:32,856 --> 01:20:35,549
...before you get
really good at it. But, yes!

931
01:20:36,292 --> 01:20:40,108
This is...!  Well, get ready for
an 800-foot

932
01:20:40,108 --> 01:20:42,624
statue of Pac-Man, with Skeletor and Heather Locklear.

933
01:20:42,977 --> 01:20:45,562
- Whatever you want.
- I'm gonna make some weird shit.

934
01:20:45,562 --> 01:20:48,970
You know, Peter, it is
a tremendous responsibility.

935
01:20:49,217 --> 01:20:52,088
Only we can remake the universe.

936
01:20:52,088 --> 01:20:55,428
Only we can take the
bridle of the cosmos...

937
01:20:55,428 --> 01:20:57,630
...and lead it to
where it needs to go.

938
01:20:59,577 --> 01:21:00,635
How?

939
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:13,771
Come with me.

940
01:21:24,703 --> 01:21:26,745
Drax.
Drax. Drax.

941
01:21:26,745 --> 01:21:28,997
Drax.
We need to talk.

942
01:21:31,109 --> 01:21:35,419
I'm sorry. But I like a woman with
some meat on her bones.

943
01:21:35,731 --> 01:21:38,107
- What?
- I tried to let you down easily by

944
01:21:38,107 --> 01:21:42,606
- telling you I found you disgusting.
- No, that's not why...

945
01:21:46,409 --> 01:21:47,974
What are you doing?

946
01:21:48,667 --> 01:21:51,310
I'm imagining being with you.

947
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:54,318
Drax, that's not...
I don't like you like that.

948
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:57,134
I don't even know the
type of thing you are.

949
01:21:57,134 --> 01:21:59,950
Hey!
There's no need to get personal.

950
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:03,355
Listen!
Ego's gotten exactly what he wanted.

951
01:22:03,355 --> 01:22:06,313
I should have told you earlier.
I is stupid.

952
01:22:07,328 --> 01:22:08,946
You are in danger.

953
01:22:15,590 --> 01:22:17,129
What is that?

954
01:22:19,667 --> 01:22:24,291
Now, you need to readjust
the way you process life.

955
01:22:24,291 --> 01:22:27,695
Everything around us,
including the girl...

956
01:22:27,695 --> 01:22:31,501
...everything is temporary.

957
01:22:31,932 --> 01:22:34,785
We are forever.

958
01:22:35,286 --> 01:22:36,786
Doesn't eternity get boring?

959
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:38,970
Not if you have a purpose, Peter.

960
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:41,407
Which is why you're here.

961
01:22:42,013 --> 01:22:44,462
I told you how all those years ago...

962
01:22:44,462 --> 01:22:48,698
...I had an unceasing
impulse to find life.

963
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:53,718
But what I did not tell you
is how I finally did find it.

964
01:22:54,806 --> 01:22:56,988
It was all so...

965
01:22:58,730 --> 01:23:00,280
...disappointing.

966
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:03,938
And that is when I came...

967
01:23:04,913 --> 01:23:09,448
...to a profound realization.

968
01:23:10,417 --> 01:23:15,084
My innate desire to
seek out other life...

969
01:23:15,697 --> 01:23:20,530
...was not so that I
could walk among that life.

970
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:24,419
Peter.

971
01:23:25,035 --> 01:23:28,386
I have found meaning.

972
01:23:47,063 --> 01:23:49,508
I see it.

973
01:23:50,766 --> 01:23:52,645
Eternity.

974
01:23:53,165 --> 01:23:55,011
Oh, my God.

975
01:24:04,511 --> 01:24:06,552
We need to get off this planet.

976
01:24:19,822 --> 01:24:23,616
Anyway, before I was so
rudely interrupted.

977
01:24:23,616 --> 01:24:26,930
At that time, I was
a Federal Express man.

978
01:24:36,532 --> 01:24:38,659
What the hell you doing, boy?

979
01:24:38,659 --> 01:24:42,055
I could tell by how you talked about him,
this Ego is bad news.

980
01:24:42,055 --> 01:24:43,643
We are here to save Quill.

981
01:24:43,643 --> 01:24:48,040
For what?  Huh?
For honor? For love?

982
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,418
No.
I don't care about those things.

983
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:53,271
I want to save Quill so I
can prove I'm better than him!

984
01:24:53,271 --> 01:24:56,125
I can lord this
over him forever.

985
01:24:57,606 --> 01:24:58,968
What are you laughing
at me for?

986
01:24:59,838 --> 01:25:03,815
Oh, you can fool yourself and
everyone else, but you can't fool me.

987
01:25:04,402 --> 01:25:05,815
I know who you are.

988
01:25:05,815 --> 01:25:08,120
You do not know anything
about me, loser.

989
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,325
I know everything about you.

990
01:25:10,697 --> 01:25:13,327
I know you play like you're the
meanest and the hardest...

991
01:25:13,327 --> 01:25:15,695
- ...but actually you're the most scared of all.
- Shut up!

992
01:25:15,695 --> 01:25:17,857
I know you steal batteries
you don't need...

993
01:25:17,857 --> 01:25:20,304
...and you push away anyone
who's willing to put up with you...

994
01:25:20,304 --> 01:25:21,920
Because just a little bit of love...

995
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:25,425
...reminds you how big and empty
that hole inside you actually is.

996
01:25:25,425 --> 01:25:28,301
- I said, shut up!
- I know them scientists that made

997
01:25:28,301 --> 01:25:31,187
- you never gave a rat's ass about you.
- I'm serious, dude.

998
01:25:31,187 --> 01:25:34,574
Just like my own damn parents,
who sold me...

999
01:25:34,574 --> 01:25:36,716
... their own little
baby, into slavery.

1000
01:25:36,716 --> 01:25:39,138
I know who you are, boy.

1001
01:25:39,138 --> 01:25:41,416
Because you're me.

1002
01:25:47,081 --> 01:25:49,381
What kind of a pair are we.

1003
01:25:50,308 --> 01:25:53,409
The kinds that's about to
go fight a planet, I reckon.

1004
01:25:53,409 --> 01:25:55,571
All right!
Okay.

1005
01:25:55,571 --> 01:25:56,410
Wait.

1006
01:25:56,982 --> 01:25:57,996
Fight a what?

1007
01:26:01,826 --> 01:26:04,143
Who are you people?
What is this place?

1008
01:26:04,143 --> 01:26:05,722
Gamora, let her go!

1009
01:26:05,722 --> 01:26:07,880
The bodies in the
caverns, who are they?

1010
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:10,149
You are scared.

1011
01:26:12,691 --> 01:26:15,974
I call it, the Expansion.

1012
01:26:16,796 --> 01:26:18,809
It is my purpose.

1013
01:26:18,809 --> 01:26:20,402
Now,

1014
01:26:20,402 --> 01:26:24,134
it is yours, as well.

1015
01:26:24,503 --> 01:26:26,330
It's beautiful.

1016
01:26:27,153 --> 01:26:29,015
Over thousands of years...

1017
01:26:29,015 --> 01:26:32,558
...I implanted thousands
of extension of myself...

1018
01:26:32,558 --> 01:26:35,130
...on thousands of worlds.

1019
01:26:35,130 --> 01:26:39,059
I need to fulfill life's
one true purpose...

1020
01:26:39,059 --> 01:26:40,766
...to grow and spread...

1021
01:26:40,766 --> 01:26:44,055
...covering all that exists...

1022
01:26:44,055 --> 01:26:48,474
...until everything is...

1023
01:26:49,198 --> 01:26:50,498
Me.

1024
01:26:50,974 --> 01:26:52,816
What did she do to me?

1025
01:26:53,106 --> 01:26:55,012
She already told me everything.

1026
01:26:55,012 --> 01:26:57,562
I only had one problem.

1027
01:26:58,082 --> 01:27:02,639
A single Celestial doesn't have
enough power for such an enterprise.

1028
01:27:03,174 --> 01:27:06,342
But two Celestials...
Well, now...

1029
01:27:06,342 --> 01:27:08,985
that just might do.

1030
01:27:11,089 --> 01:27:14,883
The bodies...
are his children.

1031
01:27:15,818 --> 01:27:17,439
Out of all my labors...

1032
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:20,784
...the most beguiling
was attempting to...

1033
01:27:20,784 --> 01:27:22,684
...graft my DNA with
that of another species.

1034
01:27:22,684 --> 01:27:25,755
I hoped the result of such
a coupling would be...

1035
01:27:25,755 --> 01:27:27,938
...enough to power the Expansion.

1036
01:27:28,313 --> 01:27:30,962
I had Yondu deliver
some of them to me.

1037
01:27:31,165 --> 01:27:33,509
It broke the Ravager code, but

1038
01:27:33,509 --> 01:27:36,211
I compensated him generously, and...

1039
01:27:36,211 --> 01:27:39,167
...to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.

1040
01:27:39,167 --> 01:27:41,716
And that was true,
they never felt a thing.

1041
01:27:41,716 --> 01:27:44,963
But, one after the
other, they failed me.

1042
01:27:45,682 --> 01:27:49,011
Not one of them
carried the Celestial genes.

1043
01:27:49,888 --> 01:27:51,713
Until you, Peter.

1044
01:27:52,501 --> 01:27:54,719
Out of all my spawn...

1045
01:27:55,537 --> 01:27:59,515
...only you carry the
connection to the light.

1046
01:27:59,864 --> 01:28:03,101
We need to find Peter now
and get off this damn planet.

1047
01:28:03,101 --> 01:28:06,795
Ego will have brought
him to his side by now.

1048
01:28:06,795 --> 01:28:09,675
- Then we just go.
- No! He's our friend.

1049
01:28:09,675 --> 01:28:12,197
All any of you do is yell at each other.

1050
01:28:12,197 --> 01:28:14,634
- You're not friends.
- You're right.

1051
01:28:15,868 --> 01:28:17,464
We're family.

1052
01:28:18,709 --> 01:28:20,845
We leave no one behind.

1053
01:28:23,953 --> 01:28:25,320
Except maybe you.

1054
01:28:27,433 --> 01:28:29,978
For the first time
in my existence...

1055
01:28:30,644 --> 01:28:33,784
...I am truly not alone!

1056
01:28:39,713 --> 01:28:41,670
What is it, son?

1057
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:45,999
My friends.

1058
01:28:46,488 --> 01:28:51,135
Oh, no, you see,
that's the mortal in you, Peter.

1059
01:28:52,052 --> 01:28:55,838
We are beyond such things.

1060
01:28:55,838 --> 01:28:57,276
Yes.

1061
01:28:59,859 --> 01:29:01,866
- Now...
- But my mother...

1062
01:29:04,225 --> 01:29:06,679
You said you loved my mother.

1063
01:29:06,679 --> 01:29:08,519
And that I did.

1064
01:29:09,584 --> 01:29:11,861
My River Lily who knew all the words

1065
01:29:11,861 --> 01:29:14,749
to every song that came over the radio.

1066
01:29:16,607 --> 01:29:19,713
I returned to Earth to
see her three times.

1067
01:29:19,713 --> 01:29:22,593
And I knew if I returned a 4th...

1068
01:29:22,593 --> 01:29:24,404
...I'd never leave.

1069
01:29:25,278 --> 01:29:26,975
The Expansion...

1070
01:29:28,635 --> 01:29:30,990
...the reason for my very
existence would be over, so...

1071
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:33,136
...I did what I had to do.

1072
01:29:33,563 --> 01:29:34,963
But...

1073
01:29:36,227 --> 01:29:39,938
it broke my heart
to put that tumor in her head.

1074
01:29:44,825 --> 01:29:46,125
What?

1075
01:29:46,125 --> 01:29:49,533
Now, now, I know 
that sounds bad.

1076
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:05,590
Who in the hell
do you think you are?

1077
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:10,506
- You killed my mother!
- I tried so hard...

1078
01:30:11,032 --> 01:30:15,136
...to find the form that best suited you...

1079
01:30:15,531 --> 01:30:18,508
...and this is
the thanks I get?

1080
01:30:18,508 --> 01:30:22,427
You really need to grow up!

1081
01:30:26,424 --> 01:30:28,805
I wanted to do this together,

1082
01:30:28,805 --> 01:30:32,947
but I suppose you'll have to learn 
by spending the next 1000 years

1083
01:30:32,947 --> 01:30:34,550
as a battery!

1084
01:30:35,993 --> 01:30:38,516
Finally.
Rocket?

1085
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:41,345
Keep that transmitter 
nearby so I can find you.

1086
01:30:41,345 --> 01:30:43,590
We're in an old piece of construction 
Wip and Yondu once used

1087
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:46,729
to slice open the bank of A'askavaria.

1088
01:30:46,729 --> 01:30:49,071
- Ego's unhinged.
- I know. Get ready.

1089
01:30:49,071 --> 01:30:50,915
Drop it, Kraglin.

1090
01:31:10,358 --> 01:31:11,736
No.

1091
01:31:23,254 --> 01:31:26,400
My life, my love,

1092
01:31:26,681 --> 01:31:29,613
my lady is the sea.

1093
01:31:31,122 --> 01:31:32,379
Peter.

1094
01:31:32,999 --> 01:31:35,967
This is the sea.

1095
01:32:16,508 --> 01:32:18,880
Hey there, jackass!

1096
01:32:27,202 --> 01:32:30,007
What is that thing?

1097
01:32:35,611 --> 01:32:38,281
Out of the way, 
dumber, smaller Groot!

1098
01:32:42,069 --> 01:32:44,209
I told you something 
didn't feel right.

1099
01:32:44,209 --> 01:32:46,784
I told you so? It's just what 
I hate to hear right now.

1100
01:32:46,784 --> 01:32:50,134
- I came back, didn't I?
- Because of our unspoken thing.

1101
01:32:50,134 --> 01:32:52,035
There's no unspoken thing.

1102
01:32:52,035 --> 01:32:54,159
What are you doing? 
You could've killed us all.

1103
01:32:54,159 --> 01:32:56,987
- "Ahn... Thank you, Rocket"?
- We had it under control.

1104
01:32:56,987 --> 01:33:00,245
We did not. That is only an 
extension of his true self.

1105
01:33:00,245 --> 01:33:01,345
He'll be back soon.

1106
01:33:01,345 --> 01:33:04,342
- What's Smurfette doing here?
- Whatever I need to get a damn ride home.

1107
01:33:04,342 --> 01:33:07,634
- She tried to murder me!
- I saved you, you stupid fox!

1108
01:33:07,634 --> 01:33:09,761
- He's not a fox.
- I am Groot.

1109
01:33:09,761 --> 01:33:11,894
- I'm not a "rabboon" either.
- I am Groot.

1110
01:33:11,894 --> 01:33:13,727
Raccoon. Whatever.

1111
01:33:16,570 --> 01:33:19,309
- How do we kill a Celestial?
- There's a center to him.

1112
01:33:19,309 --> 01:33:22,947
His brain, his soul, whatever it is, 
in some sort of protective shell.

1113
01:33:22,947 --> 01:33:25,528
It's in the caverns 
below the surface.

1114
01:33:27,176 --> 01:33:28,576
Yondu?

1115
01:33:36,563 --> 01:33:38,064
Thrusters are out.

1116
01:33:38,064 --> 01:33:39,906
Guess I should be 
glad I was a skinny kid,

1117
01:33:39,906 --> 01:33:41,731
otherwise you woulda 
delivered me to this maniac.

1118
01:33:41,731 --> 01:33:44,021
You still reckon that's the reason 
I kept you around, you idiot?

1119
01:33:44,021 --> 01:33:45,928
That's what you told 
me, you old doofus.

1120
01:33:45,928 --> 01:33:48,556
Well once I figured out what
happened to them other kids...

1121
01:33:48,556 --> 01:33:51,200
- I wasn't gonna hand you over.
- You said you were gonna eat me.

1122
01:33:51,745 --> 01:33:54,311
- That was being funny!
- Not to me!

1123
01:33:54,311 --> 01:33:55,875
You people have issues.

1124
01:33:55,875 --> 01:33:58,173
Well of course I have issues.

1125
01:33:58,173 --> 01:34:00,226
That's my freaking father!

1126
01:34:00,779 --> 01:34:02,545
Thrusters are back up.

1127
01:34:14,481 --> 01:34:16,726
- We should be going up!
- We can't.

1128
01:34:16,726 --> 01:34:19,264
Ego wants to eradicate 
the universe as we know it.

1129
01:34:19,264 --> 01:34:20,451
We have to kill him.

1130
01:34:20,451 --> 01:34:22,339
- Rocket!
- Yup!

1131
01:34:34,838 --> 01:34:36,575
So we're saving the galaxy again?

1132
01:34:36,575 --> 01:34:39,397
- I guess.
- Awesome!

1133
01:34:40,882 --> 01:34:42,953
We're really gonna be 
able to jack up our price

1134
01:34:42,953 --> 01:34:44,842
if we're 2-time galaxy saving.

1135
01:34:44,842 --> 01:34:46,800
I seriously can't believe 
that's where your mind goes.

1136
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,473
It was just a random thought,
man. I thought we were friends?

1137
01:34:49,473 --> 01:34:51,822
Of course, I care about
the planets and the buildings...

1138
01:34:51,822 --> 01:34:53,563
and all the animals 
and the planets.

1139
01:34:53,563 --> 01:34:54,769
And the people.

1140
01:34:54,769 --> 01:34:59,548
The crabby puppy's so cute.
He makes me want to die!

1141
01:35:11,371 --> 01:35:13,227
Soup! Soup!

1142
01:35:34,377 --> 01:35:36,906
Pilots, release envoy units.

1143
01:35:38,594 --> 01:35:42,636
Our sensors detect a battery
below the surface of the planet.

1144
01:35:43,841 --> 01:35:45,241
Dive!

1145
01:36:01,243 --> 01:36:02,643
Cap'n?

1146
01:36:02,643 --> 01:36:03,944
Cap'n?

1147
01:36:08,252 --> 01:36:10,299
Tell me, why did Ego 
want you here?

1148
01:36:10,299 --> 01:36:12,220
He needs my genetic 
connection

1149
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:13,969
to the light to help 
destroy the universe.

1150
01:36:13,969 --> 01:36:16,133
He tried to teach me how
to control the power.

1151
01:36:16,133 --> 01:36:18,610
- So could you?
- A little.

1152
01:36:18,610 --> 01:36:21,188
- I made a ball.
- A ball?

1153
01:36:21,188 --> 01:36:22,838
I thought as hard as I could.

1154
01:36:22,838 --> 01:36:25,109
- It was all that I can come up with.
- You thought?

1155
01:36:25,109 --> 01:36:27,070
You think when I 
make this arrow fly,

1156
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:28,571
that I use my head?

1157
01:36:52,535 --> 01:36:55,639
There. That's Ego's core.

1158
01:36:58,171 --> 01:37:01,881
- That core is thick, Rocket.
- I got it covered.

1159
01:37:08,789 --> 01:37:10,189
We must hurry.

1160
01:37:10,189 --> 01:37:13,155
It will not take 
Ego long to find us.

1161
01:37:17,756 --> 01:37:19,501
Keep it steady.

1162
01:37:26,213 --> 01:37:29,052
We draw him to the 
center then we kill him.

1163
01:37:36,529 --> 01:37:39,617
- Cap'n?
- What is it, Kraglin?

1164
01:37:39,617 --> 01:37:43,102
- Hey, remember that Ayesha chick?
- Yeah, why?

1165
01:37:43,102 --> 01:37:45,474
Oh, hell!

1166
01:38:08,436 --> 01:38:10,512
Why aren't you firing the lasers?

1167
01:38:10,512 --> 01:38:12,587
They blew up the generator.

1168
01:38:12,587 --> 01:38:15,387
I think I packed a 
small detonator.

1169
01:38:15,387 --> 01:38:17,836
A detonator is worthless 
without explosives.

1170
01:38:17,836 --> 01:38:19,887
Well, we got these.

1171
01:38:20,475 --> 01:38:22,592
Is that thing strong 
enough to kill Ego?

1172
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:26,536
If it is, it will cause a chain reaction 
throughout his entire nervous system.

1173
01:38:26,799 --> 01:38:30,176
- Meaning what?
- The entire planet will explode.

1174
01:38:30,176 --> 01:38:32,184
We'll have to get 
out of here, fast.

1175
01:38:32,403 --> 01:38:34,246
I rigged the timer.

1176
01:38:34,825 --> 01:38:36,225
Go!

1177
01:38:51,798 --> 01:38:53,516
He's coming!

1178
01:38:55,446 --> 01:38:57,719
Didn't you say you can 
make him sleep?

1179
01:38:57,719 --> 01:39:00,657
When he wants. 
He's too powerful!

1180
01:39:00,657 --> 01:39:02,112
I can't!

1181
01:39:02,766 --> 01:39:04,875
You will have to 
believe in yourself.

1182
01:39:04,875 --> 01:39:08,007
Because I believe in you.

1183
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:23,180
Sleep!

1184
01:39:30,585 --> 01:39:32,613
I never thought she'd 
be able to do it...

1185
01:39:32,613 --> 01:39:35,169
with as weak and skinny 
as she appears to be.

1186
01:39:36,257 --> 01:39:39,300
I don't know how 
long I can hold him!

1187
01:39:43,156 --> 01:39:44,764
The metal's too thick.

1188
01:39:44,764 --> 01:39:48,936
For the bomb to work, we actually 
need to place it on Ego's core.

1189
01:39:49,343 --> 01:39:52,235
And our fat butts ain't gonna fit 
through those tiny holes.

1190
01:39:52,587 --> 01:39:54,192
Well...

1191
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,341
That's a terrible idea.

1192
01:39:58,341 --> 01:40:01,352
Which is the only kind of 
idea we have left.

1193
01:40:02,254 --> 01:40:03,809
Unbelievable.

1194
01:40:03,809 --> 01:40:07,313
"Rocket, do this.",
"Rocket, do that."

1195
01:40:08,482 --> 01:40:09,999
What a day.

1196
01:40:18,489 --> 01:40:22,121
All right. First, you flip this 
switch, then this switch.

1197
01:40:22,121 --> 01:40:23,754
That activates it.

1198
01:40:24,028 --> 01:40:26,325
Then you push this button.

1199
01:40:26,325 --> 01:40:29,375
Which will give you five 
minutes to get out of there.

1200
01:40:30,028 --> 01:40:31,995
Now, whatever you do...

1201
01:40:31,995 --> 01:40:34,437
Don't push this button.

1202
01:40:34,703 --> 01:40:38,873
Because that would set off the bomb 
immediately and we'll all be dead.

1203
01:40:38,873 --> 01:40:41,755
Now, repeat back 
what I just said.

1204
01:40:42,187 --> 01:40:43,943
I am Groot.

1205
01:40:44,155 --> 01:40:46,327
- I am Groot.
- That's right.

1206
01:40:46,531 --> 01:40:48,086
- I am Groot.
- No!

1207
01:40:48,367 --> 01:40:51,045
No, that's the button 
that will kill everyone!

1208
01:40:51,414 --> 01:40:52,853
Try again.

1209
01:40:55,476 --> 01:40:57,210
I am Groot.

1210
01:40:57,210 --> 01:40:59,108
I am Groot.

1211
01:40:59,686 --> 01:41:02,171
- I am Groot.
- No! That's exactly what you just said,

1212
01:41:02,171 --> 01:41:03,913
how is that even possible?

1213
01:41:03,913 --> 01:41:07,232
Which button is the button
you're supposed to push? Point to it.

1214
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:08,560
No!

1215
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,459
Hey, you're making him nervous!

1216
01:41:10,459 --> 01:41:12,287
Shut up and
give me some tape!

1217
01:41:12,287 --> 01:41:15,221
Does anybody have any tape out there?
I wanna put some tape over the death button.

1218
01:41:15,221 --> 01:41:17,716
I don't have any tape.
Let me check.

1219
01:41:18,421 --> 01:41:19,564
<i>Yo, Yondu!</i>

1220
01:41:19,564 --> 01:41:23,548
...do you have any...ouch!
Do you have any tape?

1221
01:41:25,161 --> 01:41:27,744
Gamora?
You have the tape?

1222
01:41:28,157 --> 01:41:29,244
<i>Tape!</i>

1223
01:41:29,244 --> 01:41:30,775
<i>Ah, never mind.</i>

1224
01:41:32,408 --> 01:41:35,140
Drax?
Do you have any tape?

1225
01:41:35,511 --> 01:41:37,878
Yeah, Scotch tape would work.

1226
01:41:37,878 --> 01:41:41,719
Then why did you ask me
if Scotch tape would work
if you don't have any?

1227
01:41:42,095 --> 01:41:43,392
Nobody has any tape!

1228
01:41:43,392 --> 01:41:45,861
- Not a single person has tape?
- Nope.

1229
01:41:45,861 --> 01:41:48,846
- Did you ask Nebula?
- Yes!

1230
01:41:48,846 --> 01:41:50,153
Are you sure?

1231
01:41:50,153 --> 01:41:52,713
I asked Yondu and she was 
sitting right next to him.

1232
01:41:52,713 --> 01:41:54,035
I knew you're lying!

1233
01:41:54,035 --> 01:41:56,603
You have priceless batteries and
an atomic bomb in your bag.

1234
01:41:56,603 --> 01:41:58,744
If anybody's gonna
have tape, it's you!

1235
01:41:58,744 --> 01:42:01,978
That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!

1236
01:42:01,978 --> 01:42:04,279
You are wasting
a lot of time here!

1237
01:42:10,307 --> 01:42:12,285
We're all gonna die.

1238
01:42:13,651 --> 01:42:15,971
Ah, rear thrusters are out again!

1239
01:42:15,971 --> 01:42:18,409
We're done for
without that generator!

1240
01:42:30,971 --> 01:42:32,799
<i>Guardians.</i>

1241
01:42:32,799 --> 01:42:34,768
<i>Perhaps it will provide you solace...</i>

1242
01:42:34,768 --> 01:42:37,541
...that your deaths
are not without purpose.

1243
01:42:37,541 --> 01:42:41,721
They will serve as a warning for all 
of those tempted to betray us.

1244
01:42:41,982 --> 01:42:44,971
Don't screw with the Sovereign.

1245
01:42:48,203 --> 01:42:49,521
This is gonna hurt.

1246
01:42:49,521 --> 01:42:51,529
Promises, promises.

1247
01:43:12,276 --> 01:43:13,711
No!

1248
01:43:13,711 --> 01:43:17,791
No! No! Noooo!

1249
01:43:20,802 --> 01:43:22,620
We're gonna blow!

1250
01:43:27,210 --> 01:43:29,926
Peter!
No!

1251
01:43:47,648 --> 01:43:49,042
What?

1252
01:43:49,042 --> 01:43:51,190
You look like 
Mary Poppins.

1253
01:43:51,190 --> 01:43:52,724
Is he cool?

1254
01:43:53,844 --> 01:43:55,909
Hell yeah, he's cool.

1255
01:43:55,909 --> 01:43:58,689
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

1256
01:44:23,833 --> 01:44:25,876
Mantis!
Look out!

1257
01:44:37,148 --> 01:44:39,053
She's just unconscious.

1258
01:44:55,502 --> 01:44:57,229
How long 'til the
bomb goes off?

1259
01:44:57,229 --> 01:45:00,002
In the unlikely event
that Groot doesn't kill us all...

1260
01:45:00,002 --> 01:45:01,626
about 6 minutes.

1261
01:45:06,510 --> 01:45:09,267
Kraglin, we need the
quadrant for an extraction.

1262
01:45:09,267 --> 01:45:11,526
- T-minus 5 minutes.
- Aye, cap'n.

1263
01:45:15,637 --> 01:45:18,996
Somebody's gotta be on
top when Kraglin arrives.

1264
01:45:19,407 --> 01:45:21,586
Drax, take Mantis.

1265
01:45:23,357 --> 01:45:25,086
Ow! My nipples!

1266
01:45:33,820 --> 01:45:35,496
Gamora!

1267
01:45:39,225 --> 01:45:40,963
Peter!

1268
01:46:08,351 --> 01:46:09,981
Get over it.

1269
01:46:09,981 --> 01:46:13,723
Come now, Peter.
I know this isn't what you want.

1270
01:46:16,540 --> 01:46:21,288
What kind of father would I be
to let you make this choice?

1271
01:46:55,291 --> 01:46:59,621
Soon, Peter,
we will be all there is.

1272
01:46:59,621 --> 01:47:02,821
So stop pissing me off!

1273
01:47:24,339 --> 01:47:26,697
We have to get up
to the extraction point.

1274
01:47:34,526 --> 01:47:35,826
Go!

1275
01:49:42,611 --> 01:49:43,986
I told you.

1276
01:49:44,722 --> 01:49:48,312
...I don't want
to do this alone.

1277
01:49:51,919 --> 01:49:54,474
You can not deny...

1278
01:49:54,474 --> 01:49:57,762
...the purpose the
universe has bestowed upon you.

1279
01:50:05,542 --> 01:50:08,180
Everyone, I need you
to stay back, it's not safe...

1280
01:50:08,180 --> 01:50:09,498
What is that?

1281
01:50:22,985 --> 01:50:25,585
It doesn't need to
be like this, Peter.

1282
01:50:26,672 --> 01:50:29,916
Why are you destroying
our chance?

1283
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:35,572
Stop pretending you
aren't what you are.

1284
01:50:37,111 --> 01:50:38,739
One in billions.

1285
01:50:39,425 --> 01:50:41,665
Trillions. Even more.

1286
01:50:43,459 --> 01:50:48,343
What greater meaning
can a life possibly have to offer?

1287
01:50:49,901 --> 01:50:54,215
I don't use my head
to fly the arrows, boy!

1288
01:50:54,215 --> 01:50:56,413
I use my heart...

1289
01:51:28,575 --> 01:51:32,349
You shouldn't have killed my
mom and squished my Walkman.

1290
01:52:09,157 --> 01:52:12,179
Groot! Groot, if you can
hear me, hurry up!

1291
01:52:12,179 --> 01:52:15,512
I'm not sure how long
Quill can keep him distracted!

1292
01:52:15,512 --> 01:52:17,070
<i>Groot! Hurry!</i>

1293
01:53:08,509 --> 01:53:10,947
Yondu, we're about to blow!

1294
01:53:10,947 --> 01:53:13,493
- Get to the ship!
- Not without Quill!

1295
01:53:13,493 --> 01:53:15,803
You need to take care of the twig!

1296
01:53:16,266 --> 01:53:18,082
Not without you.

1297
01:53:19,037 --> 01:53:22,580
I ain't done nothing right
my whole damn life, rat.

1298
01:53:25,087 --> 01:53:26,862
You need to give me this.

1299
01:53:36,852 --> 01:53:39,292
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

1300
01:53:39,292 --> 01:53:41,025
I only have one of each.

1301
01:53:48,887 --> 01:53:50,243
I...

1302
01:53:52,545 --> 01:53:54,602
I am Groot!

1303
01:53:54,811 --> 01:53:56,454
What's that?

1304
01:53:57,368 --> 01:53:58,329
He says,

1305
01:53:58,329 --> 01:54:01,853
"Welcome to the freaking 
Guardians of the Galaxy".

1306
01:54:01,853 --> 01:54:04,624
Only he didn't use "freaking".

1307
01:54:09,868 --> 01:54:11,168
Bye, twig.

1308
01:54:12,535 --> 01:54:15,485
We're gonna have to have a real
discussion about your language.

1309
01:55:15,131 --> 01:55:16,483
Where's Peter?

1310
01:55:17,022 --> 01:55:18,678
Rocket, where is he?

1311
01:55:19,944 --> 01:55:21,244
Rocket?

1312
01:55:21,244 --> 01:55:23,389
Rocket, look at me!
Where is he?

1313
01:55:29,737 --> 01:55:32,369
No, I'm not
leaving without him.

1314
01:55:40,075 --> 01:55:41,375
I'm sorry.

1315
01:55:41,977 --> 01:55:44,593
I can only afford to
lose one friend today.

1316
01:55:45,872 --> 01:55:47,613
Kraglin, go!

1317
01:55:47,613 --> 01:55:49,013
Wait.

1318
01:55:49,492 --> 01:55:50,792
Let's hold back.

1319
01:55:52,959 --> 01:55:54,975
Rocket, where's Quill?

1320
01:55:56,692 --> 01:55:59,758
Rocket, where's Quill?

1321
01:56:01,446 --> 01:56:02,746
<i>Rocket!</i>

1322
01:56:04,358 --> 01:56:06,094
Where's Quill?

1323
01:56:07,453 --> 01:56:09,075
Where's Quill?

1324
01:56:18,558 --> 01:56:21,835
No, we need to stop it.
We need to stop it.

1325
01:56:27,794 --> 01:56:29,986
Stop, listen!
Listen to me.

1326
01:56:30,650 --> 01:56:32,349
You are a god.

1327
01:56:33,364 --> 01:56:34,904
If you kill me...

1328
01:56:35,258 --> 01:56:37,773
...you'll be just
like everybody else.

1329
01:56:39,294 --> 01:56:41,912
What's wrong with that?

1330
01:56:41,912 --> 01:56:43,459
No!

1331
01:57:37,379 --> 01:57:41,290
He may have been your father,
boy, but he wasn't your daddy.

1332
01:57:46,301 --> 01:57:48,937
I'm sorry I didn't
do none of it right.

1333
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:52,435
Damn lucky you my boy.

1334
01:57:56,450 --> 01:57:57,750
What?

1335
01:58:10,732 --> 01:58:13,441
Yondu, what are you doing?
You can't.

1336
01:58:15,127 --> 01:58:16,427
Yondu!

1337
01:58:21,765 --> 01:58:23,223
No.

1338
01:58:23,223 --> 01:58:24,902
No!

1339
01:58:27,627 --> 01:58:28,627
No!

1340
01:58:31,623 --> 01:58:34,202
No! No!

1341
01:58:35,038 --> 01:58:37,038
Oh! No!

1342
01:59:29,884 --> 01:59:32,639
I told Gamora

1343
01:59:32,639 --> 01:59:35,865
...how when I was a kid, I used to
pretend David Hasselhoff was my dad.

1344
01:59:37,375 --> 01:59:40,348
He is a singer and actor
from Earth, really famous guy.

1345
01:59:42,212 --> 01:59:43,712
Earlier, it struck me...

1346
01:59:44,866 --> 01:59:46,934
...Yondu didn't have a talking car

1347
01:59:46,934 --> 01:59:49,246
but he did have a flying arrow.

1348
01:59:49,695 --> 01:59:51,864
He didn't have the beautiful
voice of an angel...

1349
01:59:51,864 --> 01:59:53,973
...but he did have
the whistle of one.

1350
01:59:54,259 --> 01:59:57,978
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures...

1351
01:59:57,978 --> 01:59:59,809
...and hooked up with hot women...

1352
02:00:00,493 --> 02:00:02,145
...and fought robots.

1353
02:00:05,012 --> 02:00:08,514
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind
of end up being my dad after all.

1354
02:00:09,302 --> 02:00:11,015
Only, it was you, Yondu.

1355
02:00:16,535 --> 02:00:18,558
I had a pretty cool dad.

1356
02:00:21,229 --> 02:00:23,050
What I'm trying to say here is...

1357
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:29,839
...sometimes the thing you're
searching for your whole life...

1358
02:00:31,563 --> 02:00:33,953
...it's right there
by your side all along.

1359
02:00:33,953 --> 02:00:35,916
You don't even know it.

1360
02:00:47,473 --> 02:00:48,873
I am Groot.

1361
02:00:50,286 --> 02:00:52,073
He did call you twig.

1362
02:00:54,328 --> 02:00:55,628
Nebula.

1363
02:01:00,422 --> 02:01:02,268
I was a child like you.

1364
02:01:03,189 --> 02:01:07,325
I was concerned with staying
alive until the next day, every day.

1365
02:01:07,325 --> 02:01:10,151
And I never considered what
Thanos was doing to you.

1366
02:01:10,402 --> 02:01:12,136
I'm trying to make it right.

1367
02:01:12,355 --> 02:01:16,912
There are little girls like you across 
the universe who are in danger.

1368
02:01:18,767 --> 02:01:20,716
You can stay with
us and help them.

1369
02:01:21,163 --> 02:01:23,531
I will help them
by killing Thanos.

1370
02:01:23,531 --> 02:01:25,634
I don't know if
that's possible.

1371
02:01:40,151 --> 02:01:42,304
You will always be my sister.

1372
02:02:25,479 --> 02:02:26,779
<i>Pete!</i>

1373
02:02:29,877 --> 02:02:33,921
The captain found this for you in a junker shop, said you'd come back to the fold someday.

1374
02:02:36,457 --> 02:02:38,768
- What is it?
- It's called a Zune.

1375
02:02:38,768 --> 02:02:41,056
It's what everybody's listening
to on Earth nowadays.

1376
02:02:41,056 --> 02:02:44,736
- It's got 300 songs on it.
- 300 songs?

1377
02:02:49,996 --> 02:02:51,351
Wait.

1378
02:02:57,697 --> 02:02:59,683
Rocket grabbed the
pieces and re-assembled it.

1379
02:02:59,683 --> 02:03:02,184
But I think Yondu would
want you to have it.

1380
02:03:05,705 --> 02:03:07,005
Thanks.

1381
02:03:08,951 --> 02:03:10,251
Cap'n.

1382
02:03:34,021 --> 02:03:36,796
<i>Father And Son:
Cat Stevens</i>

1383
02:04:24,681 --> 02:04:26,181
They came.

1384
02:04:34,129 --> 02:04:35,429
What is it?

1385
02:04:36,307 --> 02:04:39,027
I sent word to Yondu's
old Ravager buddies.

1386
02:04:39,027 --> 02:04:40,627
And told them what he did.

1387
02:04:44,314 --> 02:04:46,414
It's a Ravager funeral.

1388
02:05:14,884 --> 02:05:17,330
He didn't let us down after all, Captain.

1389
02:05:17,330 --> 02:05:19,355
No he did not, son.

1390
02:05:20,628 --> 02:05:22,628
He did not.

1391
02:05:29,222 --> 02:05:32,110
Fare thee well, old friend.

1392
02:05:35,107 --> 02:05:39,401
Yondu Udonta, I will
see you in the stars.

1393
02:05:43,883 --> 02:05:47,089
- He didn't chase them away.
- No.

1394
02:05:48,278 --> 02:05:50,250
Even though he yelled at 'em.

1395
02:05:50,952 --> 02:05:52,807
And was always mean.

1396
02:05:54,863 --> 02:05:57,310
And he stole batteries
he didn't need.

1397
02:06:02,673 --> 02:06:04,404
Well of course not.

1398
02:06:29,403 --> 02:06:30,703
What?

1399
02:06:31,351 --> 02:06:32,851
It's just...

1400
02:06:35,317 --> 02:06:37,088
...some unspoken thing.

1401
02:06:47,263 --> 02:06:49,123
It's beautiful.

1402
02:06:51,242 --> 02:06:52,542
Yes.

1403
02:06:53,793 --> 02:06:55,309
And so are you.

1404
02:06:58,047 --> 02:06:59,404
On the inside.

1405
02:07:29,062 --> 02:07:33,411
<i>THE GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY
WILL RETURN.</i></i>
